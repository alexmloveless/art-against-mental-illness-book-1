# Episode 10 Significant Quotes: Suffering for Art

## Opening Personal Reflections

> "This is getting easier. Making this podcast I mean. I'm not sure that means I'm making better or even vaguely decent podcasts. I'll leave that judgment up to you."

> "To the point that via this process I've discovered that I'm probably also dyslexic to add to my growing list of neurological peculiarities."

> "This is why we do things, because they are worth it. Either through necessity or desire to achieve something. This is an elective process. I choose to do it. Replete with all the challenges. The pain versus reward trade-off is worth it."

## The Central Challenge

> "So what if instead of telling you I basically enjoy making this, I told you that it causes me immense amounts of physical and psychological pain? What if I dedicated that suffering to the very medium of podcasting itself and to you, my listeners? Would you continue listening? Knowing that this would result in my inflicting more pain on myself? Still comfortable?"

## Core Thesis Statements

> "I specifically want to do my bit to relegate the notion that one must suffer for their art to where it belongs, the bin. A bin that is buried under seven miles of concrete that is subsequently blasted into the infinity of space, or even better, to oblivion at the heart of a star. Ideas can be dangerous, and few are more dangerous than this one."

> "Let me make myself perfectly clear. Humans suffer. Humans also make art. Some humans use the creative process to relieve some of their suffering. That is where the relationship ends, except for occasions such as stubbing your toe on a painting that you forgot to move."

> "Art no more requires suffering than you require a pot of Ben and Jerry's in your freezer. Sometimes your freezer contains cherry Garcia, sometimes it contains frozen peas, hopefully it never contains frozen body parts."

## Musical Examples and Empathy

> "When I listened to his music I moved, I felt empathy, I felt seen. Chris was an incredible musician and blessed with what many would consider one of the best and most powerful singing voices the world has ever seen. He was a millionaire with a family and legions of fans. He was also miserable, he was mentally ill. So much so, it was terminal."

> "Listening to sad songs makes me feel better, not just via Cornell and Soundgarden, but their brothers in grunge, Nirvana and Alison Chains, who both lost their singers through mental illness."

## The Reactive Principle

> "These creators did not think to themselves, I need to get me someone at trauma so I can make me some good art. Whether an artist was destined to be an artist regardless of the infliction of trauma, or whether the trauma itself motivated the decision to take up an art form, the process is always, and I mean always, reactive."

## Personal Creative Journey

> "Arts has been a refuge to me. I took it up again seriously six years ago as a means to process and treat trauma, which makes a frequent appearance in my work. As a teen, my art helped me escape a society that sought to bully and minimise me because, although I didn't realise it at the time, I was different."

> "Making art does not cause me suffering, not making art causes me suffering."

> "I'm not motivated by a need to burden others with my trauma. I would produce art whether anyone saw it or not, but I put it out there in the hopes that it might benefit others in some way, much as some of the other creators here have benefited me."

## Mental Illness vs. Emotional States

> "I'm speaking about grief, sadness and despair, as if they're the only negative mental states that emerge via art. But this is a podcast about mental illness, and these emotional states are not mental illness. Sadness does not lead to depression, although sustained sadness can. Depression does not require or imply sadness."

> "My depressions were rarely related to sadness or loss, but usually from burning out due to the constant need to mask my neurodiversity. So although depression played a role in these episodes, I now recognize them as being, in most cases, autistic burnout."

## Cultural Commentary

> "Had they spent more time listening than blindly judging, they might have noted that the track is actually a cautionary polemic about the perils of alcoholism. Note the opening lyrics. Wine is fine, but whiskey is quicker. Suicide is slow with liquor. Not a whole bunch of ambiguity there."

> "Experiencing art born of mental illness does not make you mentally ill. It validates my experience making the healing process easier."

## The Healing Power

> "From the point of view of the creator, the creation process is often also one of healing. Making art for me is a form of regulation. If I am suffering, the time spent creating gives me relief from that suffering."

> "Art does not cause suffering, it relieves it. Well, good art does."

## Moral Arguments

> "Cobain, Cornell, Plath, Van Gogh, Whitehouse and countless others, none of them owed me, you or anyone else their pain, and certainly not their lives."

> "Shunning or criticising an artist for seeming more cheerful or positive or dare I say it happy is, in a sense, equivalent to expecting a cancer sufferer to dull back their treatment so that you can continue to empathise in their struggle."

> "Suffering happens. That's a fact of life. But it is never necessary. Never. Never. It is always wrong to wish or otherwise expect someone else to experience pain for her own gratification."

## Reframing the Narrative

> "These people were not martyrs to their art or their fans. They were humans experiencing intolerable levels of illness and misery. They used art, creativity, performance as a release and a relief. And we should be thankful and feel blessed that they did. But they didn't suffer because of their art. They suffered despite their art."

> "Beauty may emerge from suffering, but this should and must be seen as a bridge to relieve the suffering of others. Not a form of vicarious titillation. If you feel the need for the latter, I can point you towards various reality TV shows and or soap operas."

> "We're not the bloody Romans."

## Final Declarations

> "The beautiful humans mentioned in this episode were more valuable to the world alive. But their memory and legacy brings so much healing and hope."

> "The world doesn't need another tragic creative and no artists, no artists, owes the world their life."

## Call to Action

> "If someone you know is expressing their distress via some form of art, then maybe they're in the process of healing and regulating. Let them be. If you suspect that they are processing trauma, grief or mental illness in real time, then don't just passively revel in it. Check in on them if you're in any position to do so. Ask them what they need. Listen with an open mind."

## Episode Framing

> "Of all the issues I touch upon, this is perhaps the one I'm most vehement and emotive about. It troubles me deeply that the suffering is seen as a necessary form of self-flagellant entertainment."
