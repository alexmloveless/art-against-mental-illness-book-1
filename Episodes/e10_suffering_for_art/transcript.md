Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art. For artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. This is getting easier. Making this podcast I mean.
I'm not sure that means I'm making better or even vaguely decent podcasts. I'll leave that judgment
up to you. But making this is easier than it was a couple of months ago when I started,
which was done largely on a whim. I had to figure out how to do this mostly from scratch.
I mean I have some base requisites. Tech skills, ability to articulate myself, a bit of money,
residing at a point in time when doing such things is not only possible but fairly easy
and in the country with enough freedom and prosperity to allow me to do so.
But even so I found it somewhat challenging. Just figuring it all out was a bit of a brain bender.
As I've stated before, I find reading and talking somewhat challenging. To the point that via this
process I've discovered that I'm probably also dyslexic to add to my growing list of neurological
peculiarities. I find self-promotion particularly challenging. And thanks to my ever assertive ADHD,
the fact that I've managed to follow through to this point is something approaching a miracle.
But here we are. Assuming that there is a you out there, maybe I'm talking to myself. Nothing
unusual there. But I've overcome most of this. I'm getting better at the reading and talking thing.
The last recording I did took considerably less time than any of the previous ones did
by merit of not needing to record every line several times. Just most of them. I expect it will
get easier too. To a point at least. Despite my apparent no coward-esque eloquence, this doesn't
come natural to me and I doubt it ever will. Getting these edited, distributed and promoted
will likely continue to be a chore until such a theoretical time when I can pay someone else to do it.
But on the whole, I find that if not an enjoyable process, a rewarding one. This is why we do things,
because they are worth it. Either through necessity or desire to achieve something.
This is an elective process. I choose to do it. Replete with all the challenges.
The pain versus reward trade-off is worth it. So thank you for listening. Bye!
I'm only joking. You have to stay with me for the rest of this episode. I demand it.
You must put up with whatever insipid drivel I decide to inflict on you.
Don't fancy it? Can't take the pain? Okay then, feel free to bugger off. I can't keep you here.
You have the right to go and listen to Joan Rogan instead. Actually, don't.
Listen to literally anything else. I can recommend the history of rock music in 500 songs.
It's awesome. Right. Anyone left? Look at you. What a brave little puppet you are.
Really though, this is going to get dark in places. Seriously dark. I'll be touching on
self-harm, suicide, depression, grief and various other issues. Honestly, feel free to skip this one
if that stuff might cause you distress. I won't be offended. Anyone still there?
Okay, so what if instead of telling you I basically enjoy making this, I told you that
it causes me immense amounts of physical and psychological pain? What if I dedicated that
suffering to the very medium of podcasting itself and to you, my listeners? Would you continue
listening? Knowing that this would result in my inflicting more pain on myself? Still comfortable?
So how does Vincent van Gogh's self-portrait with bandaged ear make you feel? How about the track
I Hate Myself and I Want to Die from Nirvana's final album written by Kurt Cobain just months
before he took his own life? Here's some lyrics from that.
Running nose and running yoke, even if you have a cold still, you can still cough on me. I haven't
had my full fill. Maybe, like me, you'd like to immerse yourself in the poetry of Sylvia Plath.
She took her own life too. One of her final poems, titled Edge, contains the line, feet seem to be
saying, we have come so far, it is over. Why am I drawing your attention to these isolated,
tragic examples? Because I want you to think about the relationship between art and suffering.
I specifically want to do my bit to relegate the notion that one must suffer for their art to where
it belongs, the bin. A bin that is buried under seven miles of concrete that is subsequently
blasted into the infinity of space, or even better, to oblivion at the heart of a star.
Ideas can be dangerous, and few are more dangerous than this one.
Let me make myself perfectly clear. Humans suffer.
Humans also make art. Some humans use the creative process to relieve some of their suffering.
That is where the relationship ends, except for occasions such as stubbing your toe on a
painting that you forgot to move. Art no more requires suffering than you require a pot of
Ben and Jerry's in your freezer. Sometimes your freezer contains cherry Garcia, sometimes it
contains frozen peas, hopefully it never contains frozen body parts. Yet like brief moments that
your freezer contains cookie dough ice cream, art sometimes contains or perhaps reflects suffering.
Sometimes you eat ice cream, sometimes you listen to a sad song. Both things fulfill a need. Maybe
someone suffered to make the ice cream, someone almost certainly suffered to make that song.
This is all just fine. I love sad music, more than all the other types. One of my favourite songs is
Like Suicide by Soundgarden. Its writer and singer, Chris Cornell, would also, much later,
take his own life. I still loved that song, but Chris was not a happy guy. When I listened to his
music I moved, I felt empathy, I felt seen. Chris was an incredible musician and blessed with what
many would consider one of the best and most powerful singing voices the world has ever seen.
He was a millionaire with a family and legions of fans. He was also miserable, he was mentally ill.
So much so, it was terminal. I'm not going to pontificate here on why this might have been,
what caused such a seemingly enviable guy to take his own life. It's really none of my business.
Also, for better or for worse, many others have written about this who know much more than me.
It's just the fact that I and others have observed, mostly via the consumption of the sad,
beautiful songs that he delivered to the world. As you might have guessed from my words on this
podcast, I have been and continue to be inflicted with mental illness. When I listen to Chris's
songs I hear his pain and I empathise. I feel the pain, but I also feel a pleasure of sorts.
I feel relief, I feel identification, I feel lots of things, but what I don't feel is worse.
Listening to sad songs makes me feel better, not just via Cornell and Soundgarden, but their
brothers in grunge, Nirvana and Alison Chains, who both lost their singers through mental illness.
The early 90s was a golden age for musicians channeling their pain into their music,
but you can still find plenty of it around today, from Kendrick Lamar's guilt ridden
confessionals to the furious bile of trans trap metal artist Backwash to pretty much the whole
country music genre. Across the arts we see bearing of souls and the airing of suffering.
You'd be forgiven to thinking that this was why the arts exists.
There are plenty of legitimate reasons why suffering might be encoded in an artistic work.
Processing grief, release of anger, unburdening of guilt, relief from trauma. But one thing binds
all of these motivations together. They relate to things that have happened in the past or perhaps
are in the process of happening. These creators did not think to themselves, I need to get me
someone at trauma so I can make me some good art. Whether an artist was destined to be an artist
regardless of the infliction of trauma, or whether the trauma itself motivated the decision to take
up an art form, the process is always, and I mean always, reactive. Arts has been a refuge to me.
I took it up again seriously six years ago as a means to process and treat trauma,
which makes a frequent appearance in my work. As a teen, my art helped me escape a society that
sought to bully and minimise me because, although I didn't realise it at the time, I was different.
It's still a refuge, but now it is both a therapy and a podium for me to share my pain as well as
my healing. I'm not motivated by a need to burden others with my trauma. I would produce art whether
anyone saw it or not, but I put it out there in the hopes that it might benefit others in some way,
much as some of the other creators here have benefited me. Making art does not cause me
suffering, not making art causes me suffering. More generally, this is how we, humans, process
grief, sadness and trauma. We share. I find it hard to connect with people on an interpersonal
level, despite my habitual, brutal openness, so I share it in a way that feels comfortable and
appropriate to me. There are many others like me. I'm speaking about grief, sadness and despair,
as if they're the only negative mental states that emerge via art. But this is a podcast about
mental illness, and these emotional states are not mental illness. Sadness does not lead to
depression, although sustained sadness can. Depression does not require or imply sadness.
It's just as likely to be brought on by sustained stress or anxiety. Having suffered through
frequent bouts of depression my whole life, it's a theme that pervades much of my work,
whether it's explicit or not. I can see it. My depressions were rarely related to sadness or
loss, but usually from burning out due to the constant need to mask my neurodiversity. So
although depression played a role in these episodes, I now recognize them as being, in most cases,
autistic burnout. Addiction is an illness often manifest via art. Listen to Alison Change's album
Dirt, The Downward Spiral by Nine Inch Nails, Amy Winehouse's Back to Black. Of the singers on those
three albums, only Nine Inch Nails Trent Reznor survives, and thank god he does. Whole swathes of
Stephen King's work is about alcoholism and recovery, particularly The Shining. He's clean
and sober now, and writing so many books. But is it possible that consuming all of this sombre
art actually causes, or at least contributes to negative states of mind? I would argue not. In the
1980s, perhaps well-meaning but ultimately malignant figures from the political riot in the
US took legal action against various heavy metal acts, alleging that they were responsible, perhaps
consciously so, for the tragic acts of suicide and self-harm by several fans. One track identified as
promoting suicide was Ozzie Osbourne's Suicide Solution. Had they spent more time listening than
blindly judging, they might have noted that the track is actually a cautionary polemic about the
perils of alcoholism. Note the opening lyrics. Wine is fine, but whiskey is quicker. Suicide is slow
with liquor. Not a whole bunch of ambiguity there. All of those cases were rightly thrown out. The
whole affair illustrates the mountain of stigma, misconceptions and prejudices that existed and
continued to exist around mental illness as well as art. Experiencing art born of mental illness
does not make you mentally ill. It validates my experience making the healing process easier.
From the point of view of the creator, the creation process is often also one of healing.
Making art for me is a form of regulation. If I am suffering, the time spent creating gives me
relief from that suffering. The suffering will perhaps return, but where longer-term illness is
a feature of my existence, this relief makes recovery more likely and healing quicker.
So let me repeat. Art does not cause suffering, it relieves it. Well, good art does. It's possible,
of course, that art can cause the suffering, and some would argue that this is exactly what caused
Cobain to take the devastating action that he did, indirectly at least. It's a complex issue and one
best left to those who properly understand it. If a work of art is causing you some level of suffering,
then you should probably cease to be partied to it. Most people have that ability, although my
heart goes out to shop staff at Christmas time. If you are suffering due to some creative activity
you are partaking in, then you should consider stopping it. Yes, there are hardships from time
to time, especially when you first start such a journey. I think most of us are capable of
recognising such episodes for what they are. Teething issues. But if something is causing you
sustained misery, it might be time to try something else. You certainly don't owe it to anyone else
to feel miserable. And this is where this journey was leading to. Cobain, Cornell, Plath, Van Gogh,
Whitehouse and countless others, none of them owed me, you or anyone else their pain, and certainly
not their lives. For you and I to experience their pain, for it to feel authentic, these artists must
have experienced that pain. But let us be specific here. Depression can be fatal. It kills via
suicide. Shunning or criticising an artist for seeming more cheerful or positive or dare I say
it happy is, in a sense, equivalent to expecting a cancer sufferer to dull back their treatment so
that you can continue to empathise in their struggle. We don't need artists to suffer to gratify
our need for catharsis. Suffering happens. That's a fact of life. But it is never necessary. Never.
Never. It is always wrong to wish or otherwise expect someone else to experience pain for
her own gratification. These people were not martyrs to their art or their fans. They were
humans experiencing intolerable levels of illness and misery. They used art, creativity, performance
as a release and a relief. And we should be thankful and feel blessed that they did.
But they didn't suffer because of their art. They suffered despite their art.
Since you're listening to this podcast, I hope that you had some sense of this anyway.
Of all the issues I touch upon, this is perhaps the one I'm most vehement and emotive about.
It troubles me deeply that the suffering is seen as a necessary form of self-flagellant entertainment.
We're not the bloody Romans. Beauty may emerge from suffering, but this should and must be seen
as a bridge to relieve the suffering of others. Not a form of vicarious titillation. If you feel
the need for the latter, I can point you towards various reality TV shows and or soap operas.
I climb up for my soapbox now. The beautiful humans mentioned in this episode were more
valuable to the world alive. But their memory and legacy brings so much healing and hope.
If someone you know is expressing their distress via some form of art,
then maybe they're in the process of healing and regulating. Let them be.
If you suspect that they are processing trauma, grief or mental illness in real time,
then don't just passively revel in it. Check in on them if you're in any position to do so.
Ask them what they need. Listen with an open mind. The world doesn't need another tragic
creative and no artists, no artists, owes the world their life.
So hopefully that wasn't too traumatic for you, but I feel like these issues are important to
discuss and it certainly won't be the last time I come back to it. But I maybe next time I'll try
and have something a little bit more upbeat. In the meantime, if you enjoyed this, then please
