# Episode 41: Momentum (Part 1) - Significant Quotes

## Core Concept Definitions

### Momentum in Creativity
> "And what do I mean by momentum? Well, in physics terms, the real meaning of the word is going to have to insert a definition here. But it's the effects of when you hold a ball at the top of a slope and you let that ball roll down the slope. It gathers momentum as it goes down effectively. It has more energy."

> "So what does momentum mean in terms of things like creativity and productivity? Well, momentum implies that you're moving, stuff is being done at its most basic, but stuff begets stuff."

> "And just the freshness of ideas and where you get something done and you step back and go, this thing was good. It gives you confidence and that motivation to move on to the next thing and always lots of ideas and lots of energy. And this can only happen when you're doing things, you know, when you're when you've got a regular cadence of activity."

## The Problem Identified

### Life Changes Disrupting Routine
> "You know, I realise that this ultimately, this is a problem of momentum rather than necessarily having the time because I do have the time. I'm just struggling to use it in such a way as to be productive. And that's fundamentally about momentum because I always struggle when my life changes for the better or for the worse. One of the first things to get blown up in my routines and the routines are what maintains my momentum."

### Creative Priorities and Mental Health
> "I know this. I watch I'm working on my stuff for at least a portion of every day and for at least an hour or two every evening. This is what keeps me sane. This is what this podcast about. So I can't very well squeeze out. I don't want to."

### The Restart Challenge
> "And I think anyone who has done any jobs involved producing something, be it computer programs or PowerPoint presentations or writing a book or something, it takes a long time to restart, to reorganize your thoughts, to remember where was I, I was doing this."

> "And over time, this will really slow things down to the point where you pretty much grind to a halt, which is where I'm at."

## The Recovery Process

### Taking Mental Space
> "Well, one of the first things I do is to not do it. We might seem a bit bonkers. Yeah, well, I say I'm not doing anything. I'm doing some what I tend to do. And this is my I'll go out for work and I'll go for out for a walk. I will commit to myself that I will go back to whatever the component parts of the thing I'm trying to do."

> "And what's important about this particular part of the process is firstly, giving myself the space and the time to think and I need to be walking. I can't sit and think, but maybe just sit down in a dark room is what you need to do. But give yourself that mental space and let the pieces fall back into place and let yourself relax. Don't try. Don't force it. Just let it come to you."

### Brain Naturally Improving Ideas
> "Now, you might think you've taken a big step back. But what I often find is that when I start to revisit things like this in a sort of a bit of a free association kind of a way, my brain naturally starts to fold in new information. New things I've learned, new information, new techniques or whatever. And it's naturally getting embellished."

> "If I've lost something, it probably wasn't that important. If I've gained something, it's something I'm more interested now in. It's going to come across more salient and more fresh and it's going to provide a bit of impetus and energy for picking up something that's probably a bit old."

### Starting Action
> "And then just I think the best thing to do is rather than trying to pinpoint where you left off and where you were going, just take the shape of where you are and just get in there as quickly as possible."

> "Right, so I'm going to write this and then oh, right. Have I already said this thing or I remember that this was related to something I said earlier. I need to make sure that I don't contradict myself or whatever. And actually it forces you to go back in and look at it in a much more critical and direct way that's beneficial in the way that you're not going to do. If you just try and then to end sort of interrogation. So just just get going."

### Workspace Organization
> "But on the other hand, if you walk back into your workshop or studio, you fire up your laptop, whatever it is, then things are in a goddamn mess. Because you were rushing or you didn't upkeep things in the way that you should have done, or you're just like me, a permanent mess. That mess can be a real impediment to getting going."

> "So just be careful that you only do the amount of clean up that's necessary to get your house in order and to get moving again. And not obsess then about that thing where you clean a bit of something off the wall and suddenly you've left a bit of a clean patch and now you've got to clean the whole wall. Well, don't clean the whole wall."

## Self-Compassion and Perspective

### Not Being Self-Critical
> "One of the most important parts of this process is to not be down on this. Right. If you pick this up again, it usually means you didn't drop it because you wanted to, you dropped it because you had to. So you can forget the past because, you know, you can't change that."

> "And if you're in that mindset right now and you're beating yourself up about it, then don't. This happens to everyone, to one degree or another. You are rarely to blame for getting into this situation. And one way or the other, sitting around beating yourself up is of no value at all."

### Mental Health Connection
> "I think, if like me, you rely on creativity to maintain your mental health. I think finding yourself in such a mental fog or a real world bind is fairly great. If you don't attend to it the right way, then, as I've explained, attending to it in the wrong way might do more harm than good. Not attending to it at all is very bad."

> "So having a method, a routine for getting yourself back into things and being kind to yourself while doing it is absolutely essential. Not only for the continuation of the various projects, but in terms of maintaining your mental health."

## Communication and Support

### Finding the Right Listener
> "You want to be encouraged and you want to be able to talk things through because talking about things puts your brain in a certain cognitive mode because you're having to solve the problem of explaining it in words that someone else will understand often forces you to zoom out."

> "You need someone who's going to be able to listen and give encouragement and ask the right questions and be honest with you and not just sit there as well and go, oh, wow, you know, it's so rubbish. I feel terrible for you. Your life is miserable and all that. Because that's not helpful either, right?"

### Self-Awareness About Helping Others
> "I'm the sort of person you come to when you need advice. I'm not the sort of person you come to when you need a good listener. I just want to fix things and I can end up causing more harm than good. When I try and do that, when actually it's you that needs to fix it, you just need someone to sound off."

## Meta-Commentary

### Episode as Demonstration
> "And so, I'm giving myself all this advice. Will I take it? Well, if you're listening to this, then I might know another episode. And therefore, to some degree at least, I'm even making my difficulties."

> "If you happen to be listening to this in the future, you know, for a few months in the future, then scan ahead in my podcast feed and see if there are other episodes and see how far I've got there. And then you shall know whether this worked."
