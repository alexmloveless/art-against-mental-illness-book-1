I think that I can relate to George RR Martin

I've been trying to write an episode of this podcast for a couple of weeks now.
Oh, failing.
I started this podcast when I didn't have a job and I've been largely keeping up pretty much weekly,
sometimes more frequently, sometimes less.
Apart from a hiatus last summer when I just couldn't get myself motivated to do anything,
let alone write and record a podcast.
A few weeks ago I was managing to keep up and then the contract came my way.
Initially it was full time, now I'm working on it part time, three days a week at the moment.
And it's taken up a lot of the time that I would have been using to do this and work on my art or my projects in my workshop.
I've actually got three podcasts on the go at the moment, although I only turned in a really active right now.
Plus I've got family, I've got me to go out with friends and all the normal stuff, go shopping.
Waste time playing games or shopping for stuff.
So having these three days squeezed out of my book, something was going to have to give because even when I wasn't working,
I was very drunk and idle, even at weekends up, I was pretty much working full time, just not earning anything from it.
So yeah, I mean, stuff had to get squeezed out. Now, it becomes a matter of priorities and as much as this podcast is quite close to the top of those priorities,
it still isn't that. Right at the top of my priorities after having enough money to live is doing my projects, making the moment of making bloody furniture.
And. And I have to do that if I squeeze that out, everything else.
I know this. I watch I'm working on my stuff for at least a portion of every day and for at least an hour or two every evening.
This is what keeps me sane. This is what this podcast about.
So I can't very well squeeze out. I don't want to.
Perhaps I could have relegated my other podcast, but that one is my sort of professional podcast where we talk about the things I don't do for a living and a data scientist and list.
And if you want to understand more about that and what I do, by all means, go listen to the confusion matrix wherever you get your podcasts.
But I kind of need to keep that one alive for a couple of reasons.
One, there's two of us, me and my business partner, Pete, and therefore he has a stake in it.
So as much as he'd understand if I pulled the plug on it or slowed it down, there is a material impact on him.
And I'd feel bad until, well, as much as I love making my stuff and as much as it might actually make me some money at some point, that's not going to be any time soon.
Whereas my day job does quite a lot when it's going well.
And one of the reasons we're doing a podcast is to sort of addendum to our CVs, if you will.
You can only tell so much about a person from their CV.
If you want to know really who we are, go listen to the podcast.
And also professionally, it makes sense to keep that going.
Then also on the list, you know, family stuff and chores and shopping and all their things.
And as much as I have a lot of support in doing all of that, there's certain things that I can't do.
We're not doing family thing if I'm not involved.
And, you know, chores don't do themselves.
And I've got an amazing wife who picks up a lot of that stuff, but we still have to do some of it and tidy up after myself at the very least.
And I do a lot of cooking and stuff.
So, BAM, what am I going to get rid of?
Well, not damn well getting rid of this podcast.
It is low enough down on the priorities list as things down right now that I'm not finding it easy to find the time to do it.
But that's not all that's at play here because when I sit down to think about what I'm going to record,
and that could be a fully scripted episode.
It could be one of my unscripted monologues.
It could be interviews or any number of things I could conjure up in the future.
More studio stuff maybe.
I sort of, one of two things happened.
I have to draw a blank for going.
I don't know.
Or I hit option paralysis because actually I've cooked up quite a few things over the years and I've got several half finished scripted episodes.
I've got loads of ideas written down in various places and I'm like, what do I do?
And I've actually had an episode half finished for a while now that I expected to be the next one.
But as I started to work through it, it got more and more elaborate because I wanted to do some interesting editing to cut in some clips of music and so on.
And I started to realise that this is not a small undertaking.
And I'd like to do it and I'd like to do it justice.
So I'm like, well, that's not going to get done anytime soon.
So I guess that one goes down the list of episodes to record.
So what do I do?
So when I do have some time to do this, it's often not very productive in terms of getting me closer to actually having something written and recorded.
In fact, it goes in the opposite direction.
Now, stuff like interviews takes a lot less effort, really, because I tend to wing them a certain amount.
And then it's only an editing job.
There's not a lot of writing to be done.
And my monologues, but I've still got to arrange it.
I've still got to turn up.
I've still got to edit it and everything and just getting it arranged.
I'm not very good at organisations.
So this stuff tends to take me really longer than it would other people.
And then my monologues.
Well, actually, I can always pull one of those off.
I can do about anything.
I don't really need any prompting.
I'll just rock up and yell.
But I don't want to do too many of those because I think they lack a certain type of richness and consideration that I give to the scripted episodes.
And I can go more in deep when I'm really sure of my content when I've had time to go research and so on.
And I think those are the real high value episodes, but maybe you disagree.
But I like doing as well the reasons I do this because it forces me to go and find out some new interesting cool stuff and really sort of organise my thoughts on things.
So there's quite a lot of benefits to that type of thing.
So I really want to do a more scripted episode and then I'm finding it hard to do it because I keep on knocking things off the left.
This is probably being a little bit too big, big bit too often in the current state of things.
And so I'm getting nothing done.
And I'm sort of pondering this.
You know, I realise that this ultimately, this is a problem of momentum rather than necessarily having the time because I do have the time.
I'm just struggling to use it in such a way as to be productive.
And that's fundamentally about momentum because I always struggle when my life changes for the better or for the worse.
One of the first things to get blown up in my routines and the routines are what maintains my momentum.
And what do I mean by momentum?
Well, in physics terms, the real meaning of the word is going to have to insert a definition here.
But it's the effects of when you hold a ball at the top of a slope and you let that ball roll down the slope.
It gathers momentum as it goes down effectively.
It has more energy.
And so if you stick a barrier in its way near to the top, the force with which it will hit that barrier is less than if you stick that barrier, that measurement device further down.
The further down you go, the more momentum you have.
And then we have the idea of things like rail guns and stuff or on meteors.
But when something relatively small comes down through the atmosphere, it can do a hell of a lot of destruction simply because of the amount of energy gained through momentum.
So what does momentum mean in terms of things like creativity and productivity?
Well, momentum implies that you're moving, stuff is being done at its most basic, but stuff begets stuff.
So I'll often double up on certain things, like some of the research for one episode, I'll realize it's pertinent to something else.
Or, you know, I've got some editing to be done or some sound effects or something that I realized that I could reuse.
Maybe I'll even, you know, do a longer, for whatever reason, do a longer episode and realize that can be chopped into two, always better to be chopped into two and therefore two for the price of one.
And just the freshness of ideas and where you get something done and you step back and go, this thing was good.
It gives you confidence and that motivation to move on to the next thing and always lots of ideas and lots of energy.
And this can only happen when you're doing things, you know, when you're when you've got a regular cadence of activity and, you know, if that stops for whatever reason, maybe, like me, your life cycle is actually changing your hair a lot.
Even going on holiday, you know, maybe one week on holiday, you can keep it up, do a bit of whatever it is you do on holiday for two weeks, especially if it isn't particularly portable, you can lose a lot of momentum.
And I think anyone who has done any jobs involved producing something, be it computer programs or PowerPoint presentations or writing a book or something, it takes a long time to restart, to reorganize your thoughts, to remember where was I, I was doing this.
And so when I want to go back and continue this episode that I've been working on, I'll go back to it and I'll read the end of it, think hoping to myself that I'll just spring back where I was going with it.
And it won't. I'll go. This is I can't quite remember where I was going. What have I said?
And so go back to my notes, which are always as good as I remember them to be. And so I have to read the whole thing again, which spending how far I can take a while and then reformulate my thoughts.
And so that hour that I'd set aside for doing this is now gone. I've not got any further. And if I've now got to wait, you know, another few days before I'll get the time to look at it again.
Maybe I might slip all the way back, but I've certainly, you know, it's two steps towards one step back.
And over time, this will really slow things down to the point where you pretty much grind to a halt, which is where I'm at.
And I don't I don't think I'm going to drop this in its entirety. I'm not going to drop anything I do by because so much of it seems healthy and to be adding some of the value to the world.
But getting that momentum started up again, it's tough. And so what did you do? What did I do?
Well, one of the first things I do is to not do it.
We might seem a bit bonkers. Yeah, well, I say I'm not doing anything. I'm doing some what I tend to do. And this is my I'll go out for work and I'll go for out for a walk.
I will commit to myself that I will go back to whatever the component parts of the thing I'm trying to do.
And I'll revise it all in my head. I will take stock of what I know what I can remember, which may vary depending on how long it's been since I was doing a particular project.
And what's important about this particular part of the process is firstly, giving myself the space and the time to think and I need to be walking.
I can't sit and think, but maybe just sit down in a dark room is what you need to do. But give yourself that mental space and let the pieces fall back into place and let yourself relax.
Don't try. Don't force it. Just let it come to you. If it's not working on that day, you might have to wait and try it another day, but put it all together.
Now, you might think you've taken a big step back. But what I often find is that when I start to revisit things like this in a sort of a bit of a free association kind of a way, my brain naturally starts to fold in new information.
New things I've learned, new information, new techniques or whatever. And it's naturally getting embellished. I'm pulling out the memories and they're coming out extra.
So they've lost some stuff over here, maybe, but they've gained some stuff over there. And often that's better stuff.
If I've lost something, it probably wasn't that important. If I've gained something, it's something I'm more interested now in.
It's going to come across more salient and more fresh and it's going to provide a bit of impetus and energy for picking up something that's probably a bit old.
And it's this process that this is really the most important bit because if I can just get something, it's going to make the next thing a little bit easier and hopefully I can figure out a cadence.
And so the next thing I do is to sort of at the end of that pondering session, have a little think about why I stopped doing something.
What were the barriers? And this could be anything. It could be time-based or the situational, but it could be my computer stopped.
And so some of these things are no longer backwards. So now the computer's fixed. Maybe that's enough. Just get on with the next step.
But if like me, the impediment is likely to be ongoing for a while, I need to have a think about how I create the conditions whereby I can get a cadence going again.
And that might involve a few things. It might involve ring fencing some time and committing to using it every single week or two weeks, whatever that is.
It could be deciding that these episodes, in this case, need to come out more, less frequently, just change your overall cadence, be realistic and I'd rather put out the good quality product than rush things so I can get more out.
And is that an option for you?
And, you know, other impediments are, you know, you don't have access to the space that you needed, because maybe you moved house or something.
Or, you know, you don't have access to some resource that you previously relied on, but you can't afford the licensing on a bit of design software or something.
So what is it that's stopping you from doing what you're doing? And maybe you can tick all those off and go, no, it's not that, it's not that, it's not that.
But still, you don't feel like you can get on with it. Is it something, then, in your head? Is it something with your motivation? Are you putting barriers in your own way?
You're, you know, you're afraid of starting something in case you mess it up, that, you know, you're procrastinating. You might, it may be, actually, you're committed to doing something.
And it's really not something you're very comfortable with doing or it's out of your comfort zone or it's just something you never saw yourself doing. It violates some principle.
And you sort of regret having committed to it. Or, if you're like me, someone told you to do it. And I automatically don't want to do things people have told me to do.
It's just part of my psychological makeup. Please refer to prior episodes for this joyful little character trait.
So, are you putting barriers in your own way? And, you know, you need to decide at this point if you're going to carry on with it at the top.
Because if it really is, you know, what if I do this, I'm completely selling my soul, then don't do it, if you can possibly avoid it.
But if you're putting in barriers in your own way that are fear-based in the way of something that you really deep down do want to achieve, then start thinking about how you knock down that potential.
How you knock down that particular barrier. And we've got the biggest barriers ourselves most of the time. And they're often the hardest to knock down.
There's probably outside of the scope of this particular episode to document some examples of this.
But I must have something in my past.
Yeah, have a think about examples in my past.
But yeah, so once you've got towards to the end of that, and hopefully it shouldn't take long.
Hopefully it shouldn't take long.
So the next step is to get back to your materials and organize. And this is a tricky one, right? Because organizing things in itself can be a form of procrastination of putting something off and not really getting started.
But on the other hand, if you walk back into your workshop or studio, you fire up your laptop, whatever it is, then things are in a goddamn mess.
Because you were rushing or you didn't upkeep things in the way that you should have done, or you're just like me, a permanent mess.
That mess can be a real impediment to getting going. And if that is the case, you're better off acknowledging that.
But if you tidy up the mess, you'll find you're reminding yourself of the process that you were going through where you work with it.
And you're cleaning a clean glide path.
That means when you get down to things, it's going to reduce a lot of friction.
So just be careful that you only do the amount of clean up that's necessary to get your house in order and to get moving again.
And not obsess then about that thing where you clean a bit of something off the wall and suddenly you've left a bit of a clean patch and now you've got to clean the whole wall.
Well, don't clean the whole wall. There's plenty of time, but you need to get yourself up and running again.
So if there really is a lot of other cleaning around, you've got to clean all your other projects or your other bits, you've got to go right into the corners. Don't do it.
Create some time in the future. Figure out when you can come back and tidy up. Do the amount of tidying you need now to get going again.
Get the momentum started and keep it going and then make the time to come back to tidy things up.
And I know you think you probably never will. Maybe it won't and maybe it didn't need tidying. But if you're anything like me, there's a certain level of mess that I can tolerate before I lose my shit and just tidy everything.
Now is not the time to do it. Now is the time to get going.
And then just I think the best thing to do is rather than trying to pinpoint where you left off and where you were going, just take the shape of where you are and just get in there as quickly as possible.
And yes, maybe you've written a whole episode or chapter of the book and maybe you do need to go back from the beginning and the end, but I would just scan it.
Right, because guaranteed it's going to take a slightly different direction. And by starting to create, you're also facilitating your ability to question.
Right, so I'm going to write this and then oh, right. Have I already said this thing or I remember that this was related to something I said earlier.
I need to make sure that I don't contradict myself or whatever. And actually it forces you to go back in and look at it in a much more critical and direct way that's beneficial in the way that you're not going to do.
If you just try and then to end sort of interrogation. So just just get going. It's really important. I'm guessing there's certain past times and projects where this won't really work for.
But I think in general, you can take some form of this approach. The point is to get moving. Right. And so up until this point, you haven't really done a lot.
But by putting some prerequisites in place and getting yourself in the right mindset, you can get moving and you'll be surprised how quickly the cadence will build up.
So as opposed to putting barriers in your way and finding getting moving again, difficult and frustrating and losing your self confidence, you just get moving again with a sense of purpose and start building that momentum.
Now from here, you know, it's about maintenance, that momentum. If you put in the right groundwork, it should get back into a cadence. What's important is you don't mark yourself too low on having lower productivity and lower momentum at this point.
It takes a while for all of that to build back up again. As your brain gets back into the task that you start to, you know, get the bulk by discounts of doing multiple things at once and getting ahead on other things and so on.
It takes a while for that to kick in again. One of the most important parts of this process is to not be down on this. Right. If you pick this up again, it usually means you didn't drop it because you wanted to, you dropped it because you had to.
So you can forget the past because, you know, you can't change that. Whatever it was that caused the impediment, presumably is gone or largely gone and you just need to look forward and not be too self-critic.
If there's some lessons to be learned in terms of how to repeat such a hiatus, then give them some thought and try and put the conditions in place where you don't risk doing that again.
So much. But outside of that, it's really important to keep your spirits up and just keep moving. Maybe there will be a false start too.
I think, you know, it's all too easy to get back into these things with a gusto and then something else turns up and knocks you down again or you just don't want quite mentally there.
But don't despair. Just repeat. Repeat the process and learn from the false starts. If there is something you can change so that you remove that barrier, then change it. If it's within your power to do so.
And so, I'm giving myself all this advice. Will I take it? Well, if you're listening to this, then I might know another episode.
And therefore, to some degree at least, I'm even making my difficulties.
If you happen to be listening to this in the future, you know, for a few months in the future, then scan ahead in my podcast feed and see if there are other episodes and see how far I've got there.
And then you shall know whether this worked. I will no doubt revisit this as well at some point.
But I do need to eat my own dog food on this one. If you're like me struggling a little bit to get back on the party bus, as it were,
I hope this helps you. It gives you some
useful assistance. But I think it's really important that you take the time to understand
why you're in the position you're in. And it's really important to be honest with yourself.
Especially when it comes to whether or not you've created your own barriers.
Now, there's one more aspect to this. And it really depends on the type of person you are and how difficult you are finding getting going again.
I can talk to someone else about it, but just be slightly careful here.
Maybe talking it out, like, as is often the case with me, I find I can organize my thoughts while talking something through with someone.
And you need a good listener. You don't need someone who's going to give you solutions like I'm doing now.
You don't need someone who's going to constantly interrupt you and tell you you should do things differently or to berate you for not having done things in the first place.
Or ask you lots of questions or making lots of statements that somehow adapt to them telling you you're a bit of a failure or whatever.
Honestly, you're not asking for advice at all most of the time unless you happen to find someone who's very attuned to the type of person you are and the type of tasks that you're in, but a few of us have blessed that type of person.
And so you need someone who's going to be able to listen and give encouragement and ask the right questions and be honest with you and not just sit there as well and go, oh, wow, you know, it's so rubbish.
I feel terrible for you. Your life is miserable and all that.
Because that's not helpful either, right? You want to be encouraged and you want to be able to talk things through because talking about things puts your brain in a certain cognitive mode because you're having to solve the problem of explaining it in words that someone else will understand often forces you to zoom out.
Because one of the problems you can get into that causes you to seize up is being too in the weeds, too in the detail, just too close to it and not being able to move because you're just in the dark, covered in spaghetti bees.
And having to talk it through with someone who perhaps is not as close to you as or even is completely lacking in knowledge about whatever it is you're doing, it forces you to zoom out and to look at the bigger picture and to think about how to explain that to someone else.
And often the difficulties you've been having or a solution that you need will come out just while you're saying it.
And as opposed to asking that person to come up with an answer for you, you just come up with your own answer.
And it can be very freeing and liberating and it forces you also to not, you know, I've got a tendency when I think, oh, maybe this is the thing.
Maybe I need to do this and I'll just bugger off and do it, right? And suddenly I'm in front of my computer doing something and I've got distracted and then I'm on Amazon or something and then I'm not doing anything.
And I've wasted more time.
Whereas if you're talking to someone, it's not so easy to do that.
And if they're good, if you find the right person to do this, they're not going to allow you to go off track. They'll recognize that you're in some level of distress and the role that they need to play in it.
But you can't explain how to behave to that person. You just have to find the type of person that can do that. And that might be, well, for me, it's either my wife or my business.
My business partner, Pete, or my sister, all of which I'm really close to and understand me implicitly and tend to know how to get me through problems.
And I'd go to them depending on the type of problem. It depends on the person I'm going to talk to about it.
Whereas it could be a parent or a college lecturer or an old friend or whatever it is, but most of us know the type of person that's going to behave in the way that I'm describing.
Just be warned that picking the wrong person can be aggressively counterproductive, not because they're evil or bad or whatever.
It's just, see, I'm not that person. It depends. In many cases, I'm not that person. There are a few things I'm actually a good listener on and a good customer.
I'm a coach, but I have an almost pathological urge to fix problems when I hear them.
And I can't fix that problem for you. I doubt that very much unless we happen to have been working very recently.
I'm the sort of person you come to when you need advice.
I'm not the sort of person you come to when you need a good listener.
I just want to fix things and I can end up causing more harm than good.
When I try and do that, when actually it's you that needs to fix it, you just need someone to sound off.
And there's good people and there's bad people for this.
So, choose carefully.
And once you're in, back in the swing of things, other than, you know, checking in occasionally to make sure that you're as free and motivated as you can be to keep going.
Just keep riding that wave and you will inevitably fall off again.
We all do.
And you're often not in control of factors that dictate your ability to do one thing or another.
Just remember these things. Remember this approach.
Remember not to be hard on yourself, to give yourself a bit of time and don't get too stressed about it.
Just do the things you need to do.
And enjoy it.
Welcome back to the core thesis of this podcast.
I think, if like me, you rely on creativity to maintain your mental health.
I think finding yourself in such a mental fog or a real world bind is fairly great.
If you don't attend to it the right way, then, as I've explained, attending to it in the wrong way might do more harm than good.
Not attending to it at all is very bad.
So having a method, a routine for getting yourself back into things and being kind to yourself while doing it is absolutely essential.
Not only for the continuation of the various projects, but in terms of maintaining your mental health.
And if you're in that mindset right now and you're beating yourself up about it, then don't.
This happens to everyone, to one degree or another.
You are rarely to blame for getting into this situation.
And one way or the other, sitting around beating yourself up is of no value at all.
Learn your lessons and move on and just try and figure out how to not do it again.
No, that's not right. Figure out how to bounce back when this inevitably happens again and minimise the impacts of that.
Out there.
