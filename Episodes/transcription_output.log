[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Nobody give me sin for this
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.000]  That's reason why I try both
[00:13.000 --> 00:20.000]  If all is cold I can see a thousand times all day
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.000]  Ask against mental illness
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  The charity is run by a Danish guy who lived in Scotland called Peter Leisen
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  who also owns a picture house and intends to restore it to its former glory in the coming years
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  At some point a couple of years ago Peter was on the hunt for people who could help him build this arts charity
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  and I put my hand up
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  I've since been on a whirlwind journey that has seen us become collaborators and close friends
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  and us delivering some stuff that I thought I'd never be able to do
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  This interview was originally recorded just to get his thoughts down on what the crew was and what it represented
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  But listening back to this I was blown away by the spirit, optimism and ambition here and I wanted to share it
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  It's a great interview and not just of local interest
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  I've been banging on for years now that the antidote to the widespread social divisions that we observe
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  pretty much everywhere at the moment is community and cooperation
[01:39.000 --> 01:47.000]  By creating bonds on shared issues and activities we can build bridges between ourselves and those who may have different backgrounds and opinions from us
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  As a community we can generate optimism and action and work together to fight the ills of society
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  while also forging lasting friendships and bringing something positive, inclusive and fresh to the world
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  It could be via sports, caring the community, gardening, gaming, spirituality, inclusivity, the arts or all the above
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.000]  The point is the community, the relationships and the webs we spin that bind us together
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  So go out there, find an organisation that suits you and your particular proclivity
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  and get involved, be it online or in the real world
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  This is the story behind the community that I found in the words of its founder
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  I hope you enjoy it
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  I intend to do a few more episodes on creativity in the community in the coming months
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  So watch this space
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  I'll see you soon, bye
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  I've always driven up and down the high street here
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  and wondered what this building was all about
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  It was looking a bit different from anything else
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  I've always been curious
[02:43.000 --> 02:51.000]  And then when the for sale sign came up, that was the first time I realised, alright, okay, this is now changing hands
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  It's always been boarded up for about 10 years
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  So I've always wondered what was going to happen
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  The first time I went up for sale, I wasn't in a position to really do anything about it
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  But I subsequently learned that when I went up for sale and was up for auction sale
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  On the day of the sale, the building got listed
[03:14.000 --> 03:22.000]  So a local group of people had canvassed for trying to get the council to list the building
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  And it was listed on the day of the auction, so the auction sale fell through
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  Chris, the previous owner, then wondered what to do
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  And a year later, so he essentially put it back up for auction as a listed building
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  And that's really when I saw it again, booked a viewing
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  And I remember it absolutely vividly
[03:44.000 --> 03:51.000]  Going in and walking up the main staircase, the feature staircase, up into the projection room
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  And I opened the two doors into the gallery
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  And I just remember being absolutely blown over
[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  With the fact that this amazing 1926 Art Deco cinema was hidden behind this
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  To most kind of nondescript frontage hook
[04:10.000 --> 04:15.000]  But the amazing thing is, it's been in the same family for 60 years
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  It has started to dilapidated somewhat
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  But it has been looked after, and there's very little we can't see
[04:22.000 --> 04:30.000]  The original bones of the building, the original colours, the original carvings, features, light fittings
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  It's all there
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  So I just remember looking and thinking, oh my god, it's like stepping 100 years back in time
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  And I really got that feeling up my spine
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  And that's when I realised that I should try to preserve this
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  I put my bed in for the auction, and I won the auction
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.000]  So I was the happy owner of a 1926 Art Deco small town cinema in Oxford Island
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.000]  So that's really where the journey began
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  So the first thing you do when you suddenly have a building like that
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  And you start to say, what can we do?
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  And you start a feasibility study
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  And that's really when we realise the history of the building
[05:13.000 --> 05:18.000]  So if I take you back to 1926 when it was built
[05:18.000 --> 05:25.000]  So it was a cinematic kind of entrepreneurial time
[05:25.000 --> 05:32.000]  More and more business people realised there was a market for purpose built picture houses before then
[05:32.000 --> 05:40.000]  There had been cinema in community halls, and scouts halls, and churches and so on
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  But there wasn't really purpose built
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  So it was built with a couple of retail units
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  It had a tea room upstairs
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.000]  And you'll see in some of the press, it was like a palace
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  They described it as a palace
[05:53.000 --> 05:59.000]  And remember this was Art Deco, it was like post international exhibition in Paris
[05:59.000 --> 06:04.000]  So it wasn't actually like a modern cinema, which is essentially a black box
[06:05.000 --> 06:10.000]  This was a cinema in pastel colours and Art Deco design
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  And a cream carved ceiling in Preston
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.000]  Which is like an 1860 American kind of design
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.000]  It very quickly became the hub of the community
[06:23.000 --> 06:27.000]  That's where people met, that's where people socialised
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  They got the news from the cinema
[06:29.000 --> 06:34.000]  And it was genuinely, genuinely like an anchor point for the community
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  So back in 1926, it was silent movies
[06:38.000 --> 06:44.000]  So the first film that was shown in the picture house were the Gold Rush with Charlie Chaplin
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  And there is a musicians' pick in the cinema
[06:49.000 --> 06:55.000]  We don't quite know if there was actually musicians or piano players sitting playing down there
[06:56.000 --> 07:04.000]  But back in the 1920s, the first period of the cinema's life would have been silent movies with live music
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  People would come in, they would get the news
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.000]  They would sing the national anthem at the end of the shows
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  People would sneak out quickly to avoid having to sing it
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.000]  And then in the early 30s, and if you look in the cinema
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.000]  You'll see there's a sound chamber behind the original screen
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  That wasn't there in the beginning, so that was in the early 1930s
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  Where the speakeas suddenly became a thing
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  And obviously colour as well
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  So colour and sound were introduced over a period of time
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  And being a new cinema, obviously you had to upgrade
[07:42.000 --> 07:50.000]  So in the early 1930s, the Octolara cinema became a speakeas cinema
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  And then the following couple of decades were really the prime for cinema ever
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  It was the boom of Hollywood
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  It was just incredible, the amount of films that were made
[08:03.000 --> 08:12.000]  And in 1946, in the UK, 32 million people went to the cinema every single week
[08:12.000 --> 08:19.000]  So if you take the elderly and the babies out of that total population number
[08:19.000 --> 08:25.000]  And see, actually, almost a full population went to the cinema every single week
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  Which is just incredible
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  Well this was before common ownership of televisions, right
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  People would be able to sit at home with the wireless
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  But they couldn't watch things
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  This was the only place they could go and watch the things that were coming out of Hollywood
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  Absolutely, I mean, mainly Hollywood
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  But obviously, I mentioned Hollywood because it was the heyday of Hollywood
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  But there was actually booming cinema and film production everywhere
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  It was worldwide at sorts
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  But you're actually right, and to be honest
[08:55.000 --> 09:04.000]  The TV was what eventually had to kind of affect all the cinemas
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  So in the Octolara Picture House, or the Regal as it was called at that point
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  Was sold to the Antiques family in 1962
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  And that was as a direct result of the TV coming into more and more homes
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  Numbers of people going to the cinema was reducing
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  And all cinemas had to kind of figure out what to do next
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  Some cinema survived and continued as cinemas
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  Some cinemas were converted to bingo halls
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  If you look across the country, if you go into a bingo hall
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  It's very likely there is a false ceiling
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  And if you pop your head through the false ceiling
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  Above that, you'll probably see an old cinema
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  So that was how most cinemas were converted into bingo halls
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  For this particular one in Octolara
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  There was a survey of the local population
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  And the rumor has that actually it was really in favor of keeping the cinema
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  Or having a bingo hall
[10:05.000 --> 10:11.000]  But the Lord promised we're having none of the idea of having a bingo hall in Octolara
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  And so it was kind of shelved
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  So the thing I haven't really talked about is why build it
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  Because it's lovely to preserve an amazing old 1926 cinema
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  And to be honest, that is the romance of this project
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  To be able to restore something back to exactly how it was
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  For the original purpose
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  And we can do that because we can see everything that was there
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  So that is amazing
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  But it's only amazing if it does something for the local community
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  And the people that it touches
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  So we set up the Octolara picture house crew
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  Which is essentially going to be the charity that is going to run this place
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  And the idea is that when we get the building refurbished
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  And we run it as a venue
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  An amazing historic venue with two auditoriums
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  A restaurant, a bar, a cafe, two retail units
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  An art library and multi-use space towards the back
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  Then all the profits from this place will go into outreach work
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  And outreach work for what?
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  Well, the Octolara picture house crew
[11:22.000 --> 11:28.000]  Is a charity that wants to support anybody
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  Who needs or could benefit from a creative journey
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  And a creative journey can really be anything
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  Anything that supports that person
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  In terms of expressing themselves
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  Finding like-minded people
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  Getting camaraderies or new friends
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  A sense of belonging
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  And essentially also an opportunity to showcase what they do
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  Some people have very hidden talents
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  Sometimes there's prohibitors to people
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  Starting their creative journey in the first place
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  And actually just beginning to think about it or joining in
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.000]  And suddenly it can go from strength to strength
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  And they can find tremendous pleasure
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  Some of it is about the outputs
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  It's lovely to obviously write a piece of poetry
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  And recite it in front of other people
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  Or it could be that somebody paints a picture
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  And again is brave enough to put it out there and get critiqued
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  But quite often it's being part of the process
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  Of actually creating the artwork in the first place
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  Creating the piece of poetry
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  Making a short film
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  An animation film
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  Or maybe carve a piece of wood
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  Or anything really
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  The latest group of creatives we have
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  Is a group that do miniature painting of warhammer
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  And dungeons and dragons
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  Mini figurines
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  And again that's a completely different kind of hobby
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  From some of the other things we did
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  But it's a lovely addition to what we do
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  So you take a very broad view of creativity
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  And so you're effectively
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  I mean go into what this practically looks like in a little bit
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  But effectively you're looking for people who just want to do stuff
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  So it could be ballet
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  It could be we've got obviously already got performance
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  But you've got writers
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  But pottery I don't know
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  Just chair making
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  I'm looking at a chair
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  So the point here is to support anyone who's doing anything creative
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  Regardless of their purpose
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  And to give them support on a platform
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  To either meet other people
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  To make their creations
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  Support them to make their creations
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  I imagine if someone wanted to make a film
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  A short film say
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  Might not have enough people
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  To help them make it
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  They might not have the right equipment
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  Or access to the right equipment
[14:14.000 --> 14:15.000]  And so on
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  And the crew could put its weight behind
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  Supporting that person to deliver that
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  Maybe a bit of help with funding
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  Blah blah blah
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  And that's sort of the wider thing here
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  Someone just wants to learn how to do some watercolour
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  To someone who actually wants to make a movie
[14:33.000 --> 14:36.000]  And it's sort of anything in between
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  That's exactly it
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  Because we have to realise
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  That we're all completely different people
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  And a creative journey for one person
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  Can be completely different from a creative journey for another
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  So we're not really trying to dictate
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  What the creative journey is
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  We're not really trying to dictate
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  How it starts
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  How it's developing
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  And how it's evolving into maybe
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  Multiple creative journeys
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  Or multi-disciplined creative journeys
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  What we really want to do is encourage people
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  Who might have an urge to do something
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  But don't do it
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  So why wouldn't they do something then, Conor?
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  It could be a confidence issue
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  It could, as you say, it could be a resource issue
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  It could be a knowledge issue
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  It could be just an absolute kind of
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  An anxiety issue of
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  If I actually start to do that
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  What will happen?
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  Will I not be able to pay my bills?
[15:39.000 --> 15:43.000]  Will I find a dead end
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  And actually get depressed about it?
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  Will I be ridiculed?
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  Yeah, absolutely
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  There's a lot of kind of unknowns
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  When you try to do something
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  So our point is like
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  Trying to support, facilitate, enable
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  Remove prohibitors, remove barriers
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  And that can be simple things
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  That can be just creating an environment
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  That's actually welcoming
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  And that doesn't have prejudice
[16:13.000 --> 16:15.000]  Or judge you
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  Or dictate to you anything
[16:18.000 --> 16:21.000]  You can actually just come and participate
[16:21.000 --> 16:23.000]  On your own agenda
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  Or your own kind of readiness
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  But then of course
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  If you then opt in
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  And participate in whatever capacity
[16:33.000 --> 16:36.000]  Then we want to make sure that you can then
[16:36.000 --> 16:39.000]  Expand on that initial engagement
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  And that can be that you either want to
[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  Participate in more
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  It can be that you have an idea you want to do
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  So it requires materials, space
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  The teaching, coaching, mentoring
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.000]  And then there's all the boring things that go with some of this stuff
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  If you do something and you
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  Want to show it something
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.000]  You might need something like marketing
[17:02.000 --> 17:04.000]  You know
[17:04.000 --> 17:07.000]  If you organize an event
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  You need things like licenses
[17:10.000 --> 17:12.000]  You need insurance
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  All these kind of things that for most people are
[17:16.000 --> 17:18.000]  Not the strong point
[17:18.000 --> 17:21.000]  It's not really core to what they're trying to do
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  And they have real prohibitors to
[17:24.000 --> 17:27.000]  Actually just going on that creative journey that you want
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  So the crew is all about
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  Removing barriers, support
[17:32.000 --> 17:34.000]  And facility and showcase
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  But what is the crew and what is its relationship
[17:37.000 --> 17:40.000]  With the building of the cinema
[17:40.000 --> 17:41.000]  The picture house
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  So the crew is a group of people
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  How do you think about it as an entity
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  I mean it's also a charity
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  So it's a registered charity
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  It's a registered charity
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  It's got four trustees
[17:54.000 --> 17:56.000]  Who have got different skills
[17:56.000 --> 17:59.000]  A lot of effort is clearly going into
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  The kind of the project of creating the picture house
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  But this is back to
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  Why do you create a cultural hub
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.000]  A cultural kind of or a heritage centre
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  An art centre
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.000]  That is clearly because you want to fill it with people that enjoy
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  Spending time there
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  So the crew is
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  Although it's a charity
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  They want to create a heritage centre
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  An art centre, a cultural centre
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  For Octorada and the community beyond
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  It is essentially about impacting people's lives
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  Making it a nice environment
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.000]  And we're not ashamed of saying that
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  We are going to cheat the actual venue as a business
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  And try to run it as a profitable business
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  And then all the profits from their business
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  Will go into the charitable outcomes or purposes
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  Which is supporting people's creative journey
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  That is not necessarily happening on the premises
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  In the picture house
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.000]  So the picture house is a vehicle
[19:10.000 --> 19:14.000]  An income generating venture project
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  That will enable all these creative journeys
[19:16.000 --> 19:18.000]  Either in the picture house
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  Because we're already hoping
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  That a lot of things will be showcased in the picture house
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  But actually it's glass root
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  Glass root kind of activities, workshops
[19:28.000 --> 19:30.000]  That can happen anywhere
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  At the moment we do lots of events in the Aiden Hall in Octorada
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  We've done events in the churches
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  In collaboration with the scouts
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  And as it is right now
[19:43.000 --> 19:49.000]  We are organising events and activities in the picture house
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  But obviously if that has to close
[19:51.000 --> 19:54.000]  Because we want to regenerate it and renovate it
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  Then we will use all sorts of venues
[19:57.000 --> 20:01.000]  Across the community area
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  To do all these activities
[20:03.000 --> 20:06.000]  And so there's a group of volunteers already
[20:06.000 --> 20:08.000]  There's quite a few
[20:08.000 --> 20:10.000]  Some central core
[20:10.000 --> 20:14.000]  You've obviously got the charity and the trustees
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  But on the grounds you've got
[20:16.000 --> 20:18.000]  We'll come into the individual groups in a bit
[20:18.000 --> 20:20.000]  But there is ultimately
[20:20.000 --> 20:23.000]  There's a sort of a strata of leadership
[20:23.000 --> 20:28.000]  And then a big pool of just people
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  Who have volunteered their time
[20:30.000 --> 20:35.000]  And so that could be manning the door to an exhibition
[20:35.000 --> 20:39.000]  It could be putting up display boards for an art exhibition
[20:39.000 --> 20:43.000]  It could be doing the make-up for a theatre production
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  It could be doing the electrics or something
[20:46.000 --> 20:48.000]  For a theatre production
[20:48.000 --> 20:51.000]  So there's a group of people with a diverse set of skills
[20:51.000 --> 20:55.000]  Who have all, either regularly or one point or another
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  Given their time freely
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  To support something the crew is doing
[20:59.000 --> 21:00.000]  Absolutely
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  The crew is only the crew
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  Through all the wonderful people that give up their time
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  To support their activities
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  And naturally
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  As we talked about earlier
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  We're not prescribing anything
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  We're not dictating how things are run
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  So anybody can come along
[21:20.000 --> 21:23.000]  And kind of come up with a good idea
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  Come up with a discipline that they would like to do
[21:26.000 --> 21:29.000]  So some people will have leadership skills
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  They are driven
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  They might have a real desire to help others
[21:33.000 --> 21:35.000]  And shape a program
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  So we have been really fortunate over the last two, three years
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  That we have been able to launch like dedicated programs
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  For certain disciplines
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  And you're absolutely right
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  There's leaders within those disciplines
[21:47.000 --> 21:50.000]  They have kind of taken charge
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  And they are making things happen
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  Within that discipline, whatever it is
[21:55.000 --> 21:59.000]  There are activities, events
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  And they, quite often
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  They're either led by the leaders
[22:03.000 --> 22:06.000]  Or maybe somebody who is what we call an events leader
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  Or an activity leader
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  So to give you an example
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  Within the arts community
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  The crew art
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  We have a leadership team
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  And they kind of look at the capabilities
[22:20.000 --> 22:23.000]  The strategic kind of approach to everything
[22:23.000 --> 22:28.000]  I guess they kind of verify that everything is sensible
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  And achievable and so on
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  But in terms of actually carrying out lots of the activities
[22:34.000 --> 22:38.000]  That can be any number of people stepping up
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  And saying I'll take charge of this
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  I will lead this group
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  I will teach this group
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  Or I will organize this
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  And then get other people to come and help
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  Underneath the leaders
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  There is a large group of volunteers
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.000]  Who simply just want to be part of something
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  That is clearly good for people
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  They enjoy other people's company
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  There's a real camaraderie
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.000]  We know we're doing something really good for a lot of people
[23:08.000 --> 23:13.000]  We can see that the overall scope of the program is expanding
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  We can see more and more people participating
[23:15.000 --> 23:19.000]  And that's just so joyful for so many people
[23:19.000 --> 23:23.000]  And there is such a variety because of some people
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  They would like to be really practical
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  They might be
[23:27.000 --> 23:28.000]  We talked about the drama group
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  There's so many different things
[23:30.000 --> 23:31.000]  There's a makeup
[23:31.000 --> 23:32.000]  There's costumes
[23:32.000 --> 23:33.000]  There's props
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  There's all the technology
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.000]  Lighting
[23:36.000 --> 23:37.000]  Video
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  So there's lots of different things
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  But if you actually want to become an actor
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  Or maybe do write a piece
[23:44.000 --> 23:45.000]  Then that's more creative
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.000]  But actually you can be part of a creative team
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  With being practical with your hands
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  And maybe be behind the scenes
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  But actually making it happen
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  So there's a role for so many different kind of people
[23:59.000 --> 24:02.000]  And again, we have volunteers
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  Youngsters, kids that are volunteering
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  And we have lots of people right into their late retirement
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  As you suggested, there's no restriction here
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  A lot of the people who join up to do some level of volunteering
[24:16.000 --> 24:21.000]  Have no prior experience in any of the arts
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  That they're helping with
[24:23.000 --> 24:29.000]  And it's not in the least bit an entry criteria
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  It happens to be an arts-based program
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  But it's to bring anyone in
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  Whether they've got any experience
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  Or any interest in experience
[24:41.000 --> 24:46.000]  Because we put on the art exhibitions
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  And we said there's going to be refreshments
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  So we had volunteers manning the refreshments
[24:51.000 --> 24:54.000]  And so anyone can come along, right?
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.000]  Yeah, and some people have a prior career
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  A prior speciality
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  And obviously if they can offer that to the charity
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  As a volunteer or as a program leader
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  Or as an events leader
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.000]  I mean, that is magical
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  Because clearly if you get some very competent people
[25:13.000 --> 25:16.000]  They are able to pass on their competencies to others
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  And that can only be a good thing
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.000]  But equally, you know, a lot of people come along
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  And do something for the first time
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  And that's the beginning of them learning about that
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  And growing in confidence and so on
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  And the other thing is the kind of idea that
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  You come along, you grow in confidence
[25:34.000 --> 25:35.000]  You grow in skills
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  And then suddenly you become the one that is passing on to others
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  Or maybe take charge of a certain thing
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  Because you're now under the skin of whatever you're doing
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  And now you can actually lead others
[25:49.000 --> 25:53.000]  But there's really no specific way of getting involved
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.000]  And that's the whole point
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  We want to try to be as inclusive and open and accessible
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  Most of what we do is completely free as well
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  We want to make sure that that is not the financial situation
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  Of anybody's private kind of economy
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  That should stop them participating, you know
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  A good example was back to our miniature painting class
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  That requires some equipment
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  It requires some materials and so on
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  And we provided that
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  So anybody who comes along
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  Have a try before they can come
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  And they don't have to do anything
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.000]  They don't have to buy anything
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.000]  They want to bring anything
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  And they can literally come and try it out
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  Yeah, a mohammer is expensive
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  I can imagine, it sounds like a brand
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  But my point is they all said maybe next to somebody
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  Who has been in that hobby for five years
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  And has spent a lot of money on it
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  And can spend a lot of money on it
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  And they might be very ambitious
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  They might go to exhibitions with it
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  But again, mixing that up
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  And having an environment where people at different levels
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  Can sit side by side
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  And enjoy the hobby together
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  And enjoy inspiration
[27:04.000 --> 27:05.000]  That's what it's really about
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  I mean we've had people in
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  Obviously my side's on the art, the art exhibition side
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  But people who have come along
[27:13.000 --> 27:16.000]  And they're just turning up to man
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  Just to man the doors or something
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  And you know, no, I'm not an artist
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  I've got no previous, I just want to help out
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  And then they do that a couple of times
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  You end up chatting to them
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  And they go, yeah, I've been drawing for years
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  Or I've been painting for years
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  And it's like, okay, so you are an artist
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  And no, no, no, I'm not an artist
[27:36.000 --> 27:39.000]  And people don't think of it that way
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  Like, I do this as my hobby
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  You do that, you must be professional
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  And it's not really like that at all
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  And I think that even being involved in that experience
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  People see that actually, oh no, they're the same as me
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  I could be doing this too
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  And I think there's a lot of people out there
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.000]  And I can use my area
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  But I guarantee the people involved in the theatre
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  And all of these things, people will turn up
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  And don't really see themselves as part of that
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  Suddenly become part of it
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  And they already had the skills
[28:10.000 --> 28:14.000]  And some of the things these people turn up with, you know, blows my mind
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  You know, I mean, how could you say you're not an artist
[28:17.000 --> 28:18.000]  You know what I mean
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.000]  And I think people sometimes just need to permission
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  They need to be in an environment whereby they can just pipe up
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  And say, well, actually, I do do a bit of this
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  Can I show you something? And it's safe
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  And it's open
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  And sometimes they'll turn up with something that's, okay
[28:38.000 --> 28:41.000]  You're quite a beginner at this, but that's an opportunity
[28:41.000 --> 28:42.000]  Let's grow you
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  Or sometimes someone turns up with something amazing
[28:45.000 --> 28:49.000]  And just like, wow, how can we get this out in front of the public
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  And I think, you know, it's that
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  We almost think about it like a pipeline
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  But I think, you know, taking the more holistic view, as you're saying
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  If we can get someone in to come and just help out a bit
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.000]  With some carpentry on the theatre
[29:03.000 --> 29:06.000]  They may be young and end up doing that as a career
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  You know, that's what it's for, right?
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  Absolutely
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  And don't get me wrong
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  The crew's very ambitious
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  So we like to do things well
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  And I mean, you mentioned the theatre element of the crew
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  So crew drama
[29:21.000 --> 29:28.000]  And we've invested a lot of money in making it really, really good
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  And that includes a lot of technology
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  And technology is obviously very exciting
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  There's so much to do, video, audio, lighting, control
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.000]  And absolutely, there are future careers to be discovered
[29:42.000 --> 29:45.000]  By getting involved and being supported
[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  And that is very important
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  And when I say future careers
[29:49.000 --> 29:52.000]  It's not just for kids or youngsters
[29:52.000 --> 29:55.000]  I mean, that could be any time in your life
[29:55.000 --> 29:57.000]  Where suddenly you get exposed to something
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.000]  And you think, this is great, this is something I really enjoy
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.000]  This is actually making me smile when I get out of bed
[30:04.000 --> 30:08.000]  Because I need to go and do this and I really enjoy it
[30:08.000 --> 30:11.000]  And I mean, I don't know me personally
[30:11.000 --> 30:14.000]  I've never been to a stand-up as such
[30:14.000 --> 30:19.000]  But obviously we now, through crew words, launched Stands Alone
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  Which is like an open mic night every last Wednesday of the month
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  And I remember sitting in on the first one
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  So people go up, they get five minutes of fame
[30:27.000 --> 30:28.000]  So you book a slot
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  And you can recite poetry, you can recite the story
[30:31.000 --> 30:33.000]  You can tell jokes, you can sing a song
[30:33.000 --> 30:34.000]  It doesn't really matter
[30:34.000 --> 30:37.000]  Some people do all of that
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  I was totally blown away
[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  Because I'd never been in that environment
[30:42.000 --> 30:45.000]  And the variety was just insane
[30:46.000 --> 30:49.000]  Just some people was how they felt that day
[30:49.000 --> 30:53.000]  Other people had an angle on something from their work
[30:53.000 --> 30:56.000]  Or their family or a holiday
[30:56.000 --> 30:58.000]  And they were reflecting on these things
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  And I was actually blown away
[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  And I haven't been brave enough myself
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  To go up in front of the mic for five minutes yet
[31:06.000 --> 31:10.000]  But I'm actually considering what should I do
[31:10.000 --> 31:14.000]  Because I want to go up there and say my thing
[31:14.000 --> 31:17.000]  And I remember people sitting in the audience
[31:17.000 --> 31:19.000]  Who were not on the list
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.000]  So they had come to the event
[31:20.000 --> 31:22.000]  They were not on the list to do something
[31:22.000 --> 31:25.000]  But they got so inspired that they went up in the break and said
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  Do you know what, I've got something on my phone that I've written
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  Can I go and perform it as well?
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.000]  So it has this real kind of energy and synergy about it
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.000]  And I bet you, when people walk back from events like this
[31:38.000 --> 31:40.000]  You are creatively stimulated
[31:40.000 --> 31:43.000]  You can't wait to do something, do you?
[31:43.000 --> 31:47.000]  Well, and it raises an interesting point that we haven't really covered yet
[31:47.000 --> 31:50.000]  Which is, for one of the better terms, the audience
[31:50.000 --> 31:55.000]  And so obviously you're putting on arts-based stuff
[31:55.000 --> 31:58.000]  But it wouldn't be much of a theatre show if no one turned up to see it
[31:58.000 --> 32:01.000]  It wouldn't be much of an art exhibition if no one came in
[32:01.000 --> 32:05.000]  And so obviously the art exhibition has been going on for quite a long, longer
[32:05.000 --> 32:13.000]  We've had many, many hundreds of people through the door for over ten local art exhibitions with local artists
[32:13.000 --> 32:17.000]  And obviously the people who turned up for your cinema nights
[32:17.000 --> 32:20.000]  The people who came to the theatre
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  People who turned up for stands alone
[32:22.000 --> 32:26.000]  And as you say, some of them have turned up for entertainment
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.000]  And that's all they want
[32:28.000 --> 32:35.000]  But others, the spectres of cinema was such an incredible, ambitious production
[32:35.000 --> 32:38.000]  And so many people saw it from the local community
[32:38.000 --> 32:41.000]  And this is what's good advertising, right?
[32:41.000 --> 32:46.000]  Well, I mean, spectres of the cinema
[32:46.000 --> 32:50.000]  So it was really apt because they actually told the story of the cinema
[32:50.000 --> 32:54.000]  So it was the story of the manager
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  It was the story of the pianist
[32:56.000 --> 32:58.000]  It was the story of the orchorettes
[32:58.000 --> 33:02.000]  It was the story of the people that actually went to the cinema
[33:02.000 --> 33:04.000]  We had the architect there
[33:04.000 --> 33:07.000]  We had the entrepreneur, a bit of clear
[33:07.000 --> 33:09.000]  We had the doorman
[33:09.000 --> 33:10.000]  We had the ticketing offers
[33:10.000 --> 33:13.000]  You know, we had all the people that had been in the cinema back in the day
[33:13.000 --> 33:15.000]  And we told their story
[33:15.000 --> 33:18.000]  And yeah, it was very ambitious
[33:18.000 --> 33:20.000]  We had a lot of people coming through
[33:20.000 --> 33:22.000]  It was a production in a dilapidated building
[33:22.000 --> 33:28.000]  You know, so everything that we put in for the production was essentially a pop-up
[33:28.000 --> 33:30.000]  But incredible quality
[33:30.000 --> 33:32.000]  I'm sure everybody will agree
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  And the fact that we had to put more tickets on after the first week
[33:36.000 --> 33:40.000]  We realised we could fit a wee bit few or more people in
[33:40.000 --> 33:44.000]  And so we, after the first night, it was six shows over two nights
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  Or three nights, two shows a night
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  So we had the first two shows, realised we could put a few more in
[33:49.000 --> 33:52.000]  And they just sold out straight away
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  Which is, again, the word of mouth
[33:54.000 --> 33:57.000]  And the fact that, oh, actually, there's something good, you know
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  And this is the other thing
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  When people invest time, they can be to go along
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.000]  And nib in for 15 minutes to watch some pictures in an art exhibition
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  Or to say, I'll go along
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  And watch a drama production for an hour, an hour and a half
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.000]  Or come and watch a film at our cinema weekends
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  It's all about making sure when people leave that they think, that was really worth it
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  I'm really glad that I spent that amount of time on this
[34:27.000 --> 34:32.000]  That was spent better this way than most other things I could have done with my time
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  And that's what it's really about
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  It's about making sure that people have really good experiences
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  And that we exceed expectations
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  And I think what we have seen so far is
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  We do exceed expectations
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  Because, actually, there is an incredible amount of talent
[34:48.000 --> 34:54.000]  And if you make an effort to showcase it, to facilitate it, to house it
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.000]  Then, honestly, it is a real treat
[34:57.000 --> 35:04.000]  So several of the actors in the species of cinema are members of the drama group
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  These guys are retirees who never acted before
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  And never considered being part of a drama
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  They're not old thespians, as they were
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  And so that, for me, is the concept in motion
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  In that hundreds of people came to see a show
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.000]  And some of those people were only acting in that show because of the existence of crew
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  Yeah
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  And some of the young ones as well, right?
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  Absolutely
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.000]  But what's really amazing is there's a real momentum now, a real excitement
[35:37.000 --> 35:40.000]  I mean, the drama group is now looking at a two-year plan
[35:41.000 --> 35:45.000]  Trying to see how much they can fit in without overdoing it, you know
[35:45.000 --> 35:50.000]  And I know, for instance, one of the young actors is now writing a play
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  So that's another thing
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  It's an amateur actor
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  But he's so inspired about what is possible
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  When you actually get the support to put on a real production
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  That he said, well, I actually want to go and write my own play now
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  It was a new discipline for him
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  But he's got the right people around him
[36:09.000 --> 36:10.000]  They'll support him
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.000]  And I've heard some feedback and it's coming along fantastic
[36:14.000 --> 36:15.000]  So there we go
[36:15.000 --> 36:21.000]  Somebody who has never thought of writing themselves suddenly finds the confidence to do it
[36:21.000 --> 36:27.000]  When we first met, when you were looking for people to do anything, really, under the crew banner
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  And I said, well, I've done some art exhibitions
[36:31.000 --> 36:34.000]  When I lived down south in Windsor
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  So maybe we could try doing that
[36:36.000 --> 36:37.000]  And I've got some artwork
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  So I didn't know any artists locally
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  I'd only lived here for a couple of years
[36:42.000 --> 36:46.000]  And I didn't really know how I was going to do it
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  I just was part of a group down south
[36:48.000 --> 36:53.000]  And so I had very low expectations of what we were going to do
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  But I was like, well, I've got to do something, right?
