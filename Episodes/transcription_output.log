[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Nobody give me sin for this
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.000]  That's reason why I try both
[00:13.000 --> 00:20.000]  If all is cold I can see a thousand times all day
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.000]  Ask against mental illness
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  The charity is run by a Danish guy who lived in Scotland called Peter Leisen
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  who also owns a picture house and intends to restore it to its former glory in the coming years
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  At some point a couple of years ago Peter was on the hunt for people who could help him build this arts charity
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  and I put my hand up
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  I've since been on a whirlwind journey that has seen us become collaborators and close friends
[01:11.000 --> 01:15.000]  and us delivering some stuff that I thought I'd never be able to do
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  This interview was originally recorded just to get his thoughts down on what the crew was and what it represented
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  But listening back to this I was blown away by the spirit, optimism and ambition here and I wanted to share it
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  It's a great interview and not just of local interest
[01:30.000 --> 01:35.000]  I've been banging on for years now that the antidote to the widespread social divisions that we observe
[01:35.000 --> 01:39.000]  pretty much everywhere at the moment is community and cooperation
[01:39.000 --> 01:47.000]  By creating bonds on shared issues and activities we can build bridges between ourselves and those who may have different backgrounds and opinions from us
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  As a community we can generate optimism and action and work together to fight the ills of society
[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  while also forging lasting friendships and bringing something positive, inclusive and fresh to the world
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  It could be via sports, caring the community, gardening, gaming, spirituality, inclusivity, the arts or all the above
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.000]  The point is the community, the relationships and the webs we spin that bind us together
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  So go out there, find an organisation that suits you and your particular proclivity
[02:15.000 --> 02:18.000]  and get involved, be it online or in the real world
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  This is the story behind the community that I found in the words of its founder
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.000]  I hope you enjoy it
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  I intend to do a few more episodes on creativity in the community in the coming months
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  So watch this space
[02:30.000 --> 02:32.000]  I'll see you soon, bye
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  I've always driven up and down the high street here
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  and wondered what this building was all about
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  It was looking a bit different from anything else
[02:41.000 --> 02:43.000]  I've always been curious
[02:43.000 --> 02:51.000]  And then when the for sale sign came up, that was the first time I realised, alright, okay, this is now changing hands
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  It's always been boarded up for about 10 years
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  So I've always wondered what was going to happen
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  The first time I went up for sale, I wasn't in a position to really do anything about it
[03:03.000 --> 03:10.000]  But I subsequently learned that when I went up for sale and was up for auction sale
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  On the day of the sale, the building got listed
[03:14.000 --> 03:22.000]  So a local group of people had canvassed for trying to get the council to list the building
[03:22.000 --> 03:26.000]  And it was listed on the day of the auction, so the auction sale fell through
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  Chris, the previous owner, then wondered what to do
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  And a year later, so he essentially put it back up for auction as a listed building
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  And that's really when I saw it again, booked a viewing
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  And I remember it absolutely vividly
[03:44.000 --> 03:51.000]  Going in and walking up the main staircase, the feature staircase, up into the projection room
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.000]  And I opened the two doors into the gallery
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  And I just remember being absolutely blown over
[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  With the fact that this amazing 1926 Art Deco cinema was hidden behind this
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  To most kind of nondescript frontage hook
[04:10.000 --> 04:15.000]  But the amazing thing is, it's been in the same family for 60 years
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  It has started to dilapidated somewhat
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  But it has been looked after, and there's very little we can't see
[04:22.000 --> 04:30.000]  The original bones of the building, the original colours, the original carvings, features, light fittings
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  It's all there
[04:32.000 --> 04:39.000]  So I just remember looking and thinking, oh my god, it's like stepping 100 years back in time
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  And I really got that feeling up my spine
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.000]  And that's when I realised that I should try to preserve this
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  I put my bed in for the auction, and I won the auction
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.000]  So I was the happy owner of a 1926 Art Deco small town cinema in Oxford Island
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.000]  So that's really where the journey began
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  So the first thing you do when you suddenly have a building like that
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  And you start to say, what can we do?
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  And you start a feasibility study
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  And that's really when we realise the history of the building
[05:13.000 --> 05:18.000]  So if I take you back to 1926 when it was built
[05:18.000 --> 05:25.000]  So it was a cinematic kind of entrepreneurial time
[05:25.000 --> 05:32.000]  More and more business people realised there was a market for purpose built picture houses before then
[05:32.000 --> 05:40.000]  There had been cinema in community halls, and scouts halls, and churches and so on
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  But there wasn't really purpose built
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  So it was built with a couple of retail units
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  It had a tea room upstairs
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.000]  And you'll see in some of the press, it was like a palace
[05:52.000 --> 05:53.000]  They described it as a palace
[05:53.000 --> 05:59.000]  And remember this was Art Deco, it was like post international exhibition in Paris
[05:59.000 --> 06:04.000]  So it wasn't actually like a modern cinema, which is essentially a black box
[06:05.000 --> 06:10.000]  This was a cinema in pastel colours and Art Deco design
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  And a cream carved ceiling in Preston
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.000]  Which is like an 1860 American kind of design
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.000]  It very quickly became the hub of the community
[06:23.000 --> 06:27.000]  That's where people met, that's where people socialised
[06:27.000 --> 06:29.000]  They got the news from the cinema
[06:29.000 --> 06:34.000]  And it was genuinely, genuinely like an anchor point for the community
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  So back in 1926, it was silent movies
[06:38.000 --> 06:44.000]  So the first film that was shown in the picture house were the Gold Rush with Charlie Chaplin
[06:44.000 --> 06:49.000]  And there is a musicians' pick in the cinema
[06:49.000 --> 06:55.000]  We don't quite know if there was actually musicians or piano players sitting playing down there
[06:56.000 --> 07:04.000]  But back in the 1920s, the first period of the cinema's life would have been silent movies with live music
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  People would come in, they would get the news
[07:07.000 --> 07:11.000]  They would sing the national anthem at the end of the shows
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  People would sneak out quickly to avoid having to sing it
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.000]  And then in the early 30s, and if you look in the cinema
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.000]  You'll see there's a sound chamber behind the original screen
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  That wasn't there in the beginning, so that was in the early 1930s
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  Where the speakeas suddenly became a thing
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  And obviously colour as well
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  So colour and sound were introduced over a period of time
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  And being a new cinema, obviously you had to upgrade
[07:42.000 --> 07:50.000]  So in the early 1930s, the Octolara cinema became a speakeas cinema
[07:50.000 --> 07:57.000]  And then the following couple of decades were really the prime for cinema ever
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  It was the boom of Hollywood
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  It was just incredible, the amount of films that were made
[08:03.000 --> 08:12.000]  And in 1946, in the UK, 32 million people went to the cinema every single week
[08:12.000 --> 08:19.000]  So if you take the elderly and the babies out of that total population number
[08:19.000 --> 08:25.000]  And see, actually, almost a full population went to the cinema every single week
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  Which is just incredible
[08:27.000 --> 08:30.000]  Well this was before common ownership of televisions, right
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  People would be able to sit at home with the wireless
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  But they couldn't watch things
[08:35.000 --> 08:38.000]  This was the only place they could go and watch the things that were coming out of Hollywood
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  Absolutely, I mean, mainly Hollywood
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  But obviously, I mentioned Hollywood because it was the heyday of Hollywood
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  But there was actually booming cinema and film production everywhere
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  It was worldwide at sorts
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  But you're actually right, and to be honest
[08:55.000 --> 09:04.000]  The TV was what eventually had to kind of affect all the cinemas
[09:04.000 --> 09:09.000]  So in the Octolara Picture House, or the Regal as it was called at that point
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.000]  Was sold to the Antiques family in 1962
[09:15.000 --> 09:21.000]  And that was as a direct result of the TV coming into more and more homes
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  Numbers of people going to the cinema was reducing
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  And all cinemas had to kind of figure out what to do next
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  Some cinema survived and continued as cinemas
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  Some cinemas were converted to bingo halls
[09:35.000 --> 09:40.000]  If you look across the country, if you go into a bingo hall
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  It's very likely there is a false ceiling
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  And if you pop your head through the false ceiling
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  Above that, you'll probably see an old cinema
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  So that was how most cinemas were converted into bingo halls
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  For this particular one in Octolara
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  There was a survey of the local population
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  And the rumor has that actually it was really in favor of keeping the cinema
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  Or having a bingo hall
[10:05.000 --> 10:11.000]  But the Lord promised we're having none of the idea of having a bingo hall in Octolara
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  And so it was kind of shelved
[10:13.000 --> 10:17.000]  So the thing I haven't really talked about is why build it
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  Because it's lovely to preserve an amazing old 1926 cinema
[10:22.000 --> 10:26.000]  And to be honest, that is the romance of this project
[10:26.000 --> 10:31.000]  To be able to restore something back to exactly how it was
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  For the original purpose
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  And we can do that because we can see everything that was there
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  So that is amazing
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  But it's only amazing if it does something for the local community
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  And the people that it touches
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  So we set up the Octolara picture house crew
[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  Which is essentially going to be the charity that is going to run this place
[10:51.000 --> 10:55.000]  And the idea is that when we get the building refurbished
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.000]  And we run it as a venue
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  An amazing historic venue with two auditoriums
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  A restaurant, a bar, a cafe, two retail units
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  An art library and multi-use space towards the back
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  Then all the profits from this place will go into outreach work
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  And outreach work for what?
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  Well, the Octolara picture house crew
[11:22.000 --> 11:28.000]  Is a charity that wants to support anybody
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  Who needs or could benefit from a creative journey
[11:32.000 --> 11:35.000]  And a creative journey can really be anything
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  Anything that supports that person
[11:40.000 --> 11:43.000]  In terms of expressing themselves
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  Finding like-minded people
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  Getting camaraderies or new friends
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  A sense of belonging
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  And essentially also an opportunity to showcase what they do
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  Some people have very hidden talents
[12:01.000 --> 12:05.000]  Sometimes there's prohibitors to people
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  Starting their creative journey in the first place
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  And actually just beginning to think about it or joining in
[12:12.000 --> 12:17.000]  And suddenly it can go from strength to strength
[12:17.000 --> 12:20.000]  And they can find tremendous pleasure
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  Some of it is about the outputs
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  It's lovely to obviously write a piece of poetry
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  And recite it in front of other people
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  Or it could be that somebody paints a picture
[12:32.000 --> 12:37.000]  And again is brave enough to put it out there and get critiqued
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  But quite often it's being part of the process
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  Of actually creating the artwork in the first place
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  Creating the piece of poetry
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  Making a short film
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  An animation film
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  Or maybe carve a piece of wood
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  Or anything really
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  The latest group of creatives we have
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  Is a group that do miniature painting of warhammer
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  And dungeons and dragons
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  Mini figurines
[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  And again that's a completely different kind of hobby
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  From some of the other things we did
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  But it's a lovely addition to what we do
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  So you take a very broad view of creativity
[13:18.000 --> 13:21.000]  And so you're effectively
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  I mean go into what this practically looks like in a little bit
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  But effectively you're looking for people who just want to do stuff
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  So it could be ballet
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  It could be we've got obviously already got performance
[13:36.000 --> 13:38.000]  But you've got writers
[13:38.000 --> 13:40.000]  But pottery I don't know
[13:40.000 --> 13:41.000]  Just chair making
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  I'm looking at a chair
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  So the point here is to support anyone who's doing anything creative
[13:48.000 --> 13:50.000]  Regardless of their purpose
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  And to give them support on a platform
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  To either meet other people
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  To make their creations
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  Support them to make their creations
