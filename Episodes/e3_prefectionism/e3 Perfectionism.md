welcome to the art against mental illness podcast my name is Alex lovess and this is my podcast about the healing powers of art for artists art lovers the art curious and anyone with an interest in mental health and well-being so I've talked so far about art and creativity being a journey a process of processes a long line of moments some of which result in beautiful things being produced those moments where we actually finish something might come to infrequently but as I alluded to in the last episode they're also somewhat beside the point it all counts not just a shy bits but the shy bits are still important to most of us and give people those moments of connection that happen when you experience great art but it's easy to obsess over those moments to make them the only thing that matters and to obsess about making them perfect to obsess about making your work perfect but here there'd be dragons perfectionism isn't just a Preserve of cre it pervades the modern world and imposes itself on every corner of our Lives due to the fact that most people only share their best moments on social media and angle and Doctor them so that they show the best version of themselves possible it's easy to believe that your life is dull and insipid while everyone else is loading it up and maybe you'd think you'd feel a bit better if everyone thought you were also loading it up and so you get sucked into the same cycle everyone is glaring into a little rectang angular screen feeling worthless and looking for a little moments to share that will hopefully dup the world into thinking they're happy and carefree this can lead to some very dark places and increasingly is doing so the reported Rising occurrences of anxiety depression suicide and eating disorders may not be exclusively related to the inescapable devices and fomo but it's pretty clear that this has had a big influence this behavior is a form of perfectionism and it's corrosive you find yourself in permanent Optics mode always feeling the need to optimize improve remove floors airbrush Photoshop a whole industry has sprung up around this but in reality for most of us this is not lipstick on a pig or polishing a turd it's more like taking something beautiful and alive and pickling it sticking a pin in a butterfly I think it leaks into every part of our Lives everything we own and do has to be perfect in case someone else sees it and soon there are no safe spaces no way you can Rel Rel not because other people can see you but because you can perfectionism is something that I think pretty much all good artists suffer from I say good artists cuz there are narcissists out there that produce utter crap firmly believing it to be genius they suffer from the opposite of perfectionism but for the rest of us it's a persistent blight I think it's especially pervasive in the early stages of the creative Journey before you've really found your voice your audience your confidence and before before you know what good looks like for you but artists of all levels of experience and popularity experience it to a degree it's inevitable and sometimes even appropriate and helpful but most of the time it's not most of the time it's a destructive illusion so what is perfectionism in the context of the creative process maybe it's easy to Define what it's not the opposite of perfectionism is knowing when to stop knowing when a piece of art is finished ready to ship one of the most important skills you'd learn is a Creator is knowing when to stop when to stand back and say that's enough it's not as easy as you might think sometimes but very rarely a work is obviously finished just as you conceived it to be done this has never happened to me not least because I don't plan my Works they just tend to emerge so the idea of done is a little more fluid I think even the most meticulous and deliberate artists expect and encourage an element of Randomness in their work artworks without this tend to be flat and stale in my opinion most artists aren't very deliberate in my experience that's kind of the point of art otherwise it's really just manufacturing so the concept of done is a kind of mutable or firal one and it's often very hard to know when something is done when asked how I know when a painting is finished I always find it hard to give a satisfactory answer as an aside I think only other artists ever asked this question everyone else seems to imagine that our work exudes from a magic unicorn horn maybe it's better that they do but I'm not a unicorn and my work takes well work so when pressed on how I know when a piece of art is finished the best answer I can think of apart from the unicorn horn one is when adding more to it would make it less good this is a deeply unsatisfactory response even to me some obvious objections being surely a work in production goes through Peaks and troughs you can't just bail on it because something went wrong I'm always cocking things up while in flow in fact I generally encourage mistakes some of the best work I've done is as a result of happy accidents there have been times and I've created a finished work that I wish based on F evidence that I'd stopped adding to many iterations ago the second and much more confounding objection is simply the usual follow-up question again usually from artists how do you know what good looks like the answer to that is the same answer that I should have given in the first place and one that is even less satisfactory than in the other answers which is well you just sort of no no one likes a smart ass is the usual irritated reaction to that but unfortunately it's the only meaningful answer even if it's only actually meaningful to me this type of response is especially ging to beginners who just assume you're being obtuse or aloof or evasive or just plain condescending the naive response and one that often emerges from beginners is see what other people think finish looks like and use that as a guide and this is where we get into seriously ugly ter because what you're really saying is I'm going to compare my work to someone else's which is always and I mean always a terrible idea and at last we find ourselves back to perfectionism you see the experience of art is deeply subjective and deeply intimate even in the most shallow kind of art everyone's art has its own signature both figuratively and literally that is as unique as their fingerprint this is called style or voice so of course you can compare your work to other in the same genre but your finished and their finished may be and should be very different even if you set out to copy someone else presuming that is you're not a forger then you should and will diverge from that to develop your own flavor this is how art works and since it's their style that can only have ever emanated from them you cannot possibly replicate it but what many people do is set their sites on reverently emulating another artist and then tear themselves apart failing to do so all the while berating themselves for not producing the quality of piece that they set out to do at that point it doesn't really matter how good your actual work is it will never be good enough you're looking at it through the wrong eyes this is perfectionism not then the pursuit of perfection but a pursuit of emulation the pursuit of someone else's idea of perfection the result of this can only be consistent failure not failure to produce good work but failure to recognize your own good work this is a disastrous outcome it's demoralizing and depressing and stressful and it has stopped many AB buding creative in their tracks many simply give up at that point and that's a terrible outcome but much like the perfect selfie Obsession it's an illusion a self-impose self-destructive Doom Loop and one that you need to get out of ASAP if you want to make good work more importantly at least in my view you need to shake this attitude because it largely negates the therapeutic value of the process of creation since statistically speaking you might want to use the healing power of art because of the anxieties bought on by social and societal pressures letting the very same predator in the ring is probably not the best idea and perfectionism is hard to spot not least because it doesn't just come in the form I've already discussed for more experienced artists the genius that they have been trying and failing to emulate is actually themselves too many creators can get sucked into the Doom spiral of trying to recreate supposed form of glories rather than recognizing and celebrating their own progression not least because those form of glories are often the result of Praise from others particularly in the artist formative stages paying too much attention to your fans or critics is a dangerous game and one that I'll no doubt revisit at some point but understand this the only opinion that really matters is your own other people tend to tell you things that you want to hear for all the nicest possible of reasons that earlier supposed Master work might well just be an average early work that found the right eyes after all Bob Ross has a lot of fans but did you really want to get off the bus at his stop and stay there forever even if you did produce an actual item of Genius that was then and this is now and did we not talk already about art being all about the process move on your life may depend on it whatever form your perfectionism takes is always destructive and rarely leads to actual good works usually it leads to Flat finicky emotionally stunted works or just an overworked Brown that gets discarded or even worse no work at all and it always always leads to misery and disillusionment perfectionism is an evasive animal that prefers not to be seen But hides in plain sight it is irrationality masquerading as common sense I'm aware that this leaves a Troublesome question of how to know when a work is finished well sometimes I do just know sometimes I do keep going a little too long and realize that I'm making a perfectly good work well less good hopefully not too much less good that it's ruined but more often I get to the point where I think piece may be finished and just can't decide I have a special solution for this type of situation I ask myself no no stop getting angry with me I'm not being obtuse and condescending again what I mean is I simply put that work aside preferably where I can't see it for a few days weeks months sometimes even years then at some point go back to look at it nine times out of 10 I know immediately if it's finished and if it's not the fix is usually immediately apparent and sometimes I realize that it's a complete turkey and hide it away again until I decide what to do with it and that's fine too but the fresh eyes are important you need to get some distance between yourself and that work that person who revisits that work is a different person even though it's still you and there's no better more caring and nurturing supporter than yourself there's also none harsher critic but now we're back to perfectionism again and that's where this all really comes back to we are our own worst critics sometimes this is necessary but most of the time it's not and left unchecked it can become pathological believe me I know the good thing is whereas we can't control our critics out there in the real world we can control to a degree at least our inner critic at the very least we can ignore them or tell them to shut the hell up and so to your homework go and find some work that you didn't like but haven't seen for a while maybe a sketch that you filed at the back of your sketch pad so no one can see it may be an old short story that you never shared with anyone cuz you thought it was lame go look at it again and observe how it makes you feel maybe it's still a turkey but maybe there's something there maybe there's something you can work into something else you can be proud of or maybe it's a forgotten work of Genius recently I was sorting through some old discarded artworks and I found a watercolor landscape that I remember thinking at the time was terrible watercolor isn't really my medium anyway but seeing it again I was actually Gob smacked it might be the best watercolor of ever done I kid you not so go have a rumage and I'll see you next time when I'll be talking about the scariest but perhaps the most rewarding part of the creative Journey sharing your work I hope you enjoyed this episode and found it helpful if you did
