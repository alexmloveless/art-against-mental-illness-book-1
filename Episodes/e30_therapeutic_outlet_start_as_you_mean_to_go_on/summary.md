# Episode 30: Therapeutic Outlet - Start as You Mean to Go On

## Episode Summary

Alex begins 2025 with a manifesto of intentions rather than resolutions, acknowledging the chaotic state of the world while determining to do "whatever the bloody well I please." The episode outlines both what Alex intends to do and what they won't do in 2025.

### Key Intentions (The "Do's"):

1. **Try New Things**: Experimenting with abstract art and wood carving using a rotary tool, embracing the process over perfect outcomes
2. **Use What You Have**: Repurpose existing materials and resources to save money, reduce waste, and give items a second life
3. **Make New Friends and Connect**: Leverage the podcast and local art group to build community and relationships
4. **Find New Artists**: Discover new artists to collaborate with and learn from, expanding artistic horizons
5. **Keep Spreading the Love**: Continue encouraging creativity as mental health therapy and community building
6. **Aim High**: Build on 2024's achievements while protecting mental health and avoiding burnout

### Key Boundaries (The "Don'ts"):

1. **Don't Break Myself Again**: Primary commitment to mental health preservation
2. **Don't Worry About World Events**: Limit doom scrolling and emotional drain from politics/news
3. **Don't Sweat the Small Stuff**: Focus on accumulating positive rather than dwelling on minor setbacks
4. **Don't Worry About Others' Opinions**: Accept being "Marmite" - some will like the work, others won't
5. **Don't Stress About Social Media Algorithms**: Particularly Meta platforms that no longer serve artists well
6. **Don't Worry About Podcast Listener Numbers**: Focus on value for existing audience rather than growth metrics

### Core Philosophy

These are described as "intentions" rather than resolutions - more like a boat to navigate the year than fixed destinations. Alex emphasizes the journey over the destination, maintaining flexibility while having clear values and direction.

The episode reinforces the central theme that art and creativity serve as antidotes to isolation and division, with community building as essential for mental health and social healing.
