welcome to the art against mental illness podcast my name is Alex lovess and this is my podcast about the healing powers of art for artists art lovers the art curious and anyone with an interest in mental health and well-being we're used to getting what we want in the modern world and I don't mean by that the Ferrari and the hot spouse I mean when we want a big greasy burger with all the toppings we go out the house and we get one and I'll take a thick Shake in large fries with that thank you very much when we want to get smashed we'll just go and buy some beers or go to the pub and get smashed if you want a weeklong trail of deucher in the south of Spain just go do it no problem when you want to see what your friends are doing grab your phone go take a look you'll probably find them on a weekl long trail of Deery in the south of Spain in fact doing so was probably the very thing that led you to decide to want to go on a weekl long trail of debauchery in the south of Spain in the first place you do this because you can because fun tasty and cool things are available and they're relatively cheap although perhaps not as cheap as they used to be but for those of you with a bit of disposable income there's nothing really stopping you the world's full of people doing what they feel like and having all or at least many of the things they want some people have more than you some people have less this perceived social imbalance causes us to be constantly alert to our status in the world what we have and what we don't things we do and things we don't how people view US For Better or For Worse it comes as an almost uninterrupted stream via little glowing rectangles that we keep in our pockets or bags this tends to leave us with the feeling that we're missing something or lacking something all the time therefore you go eat a big burger you go get smashed out of your skull in a pub you go on holiday to the south of Spain where you spend all your time looking at your phone only to find that your best friends on holiday in the SE shells or climbing Mount Everest or something equally enviable or impressive so there you are experiencing the very thing that you craved yet feeling it a deficit as you stare at your lukewarm murky looking pina colada in a crowded Spanish bar full of other Brits with sunburn swearing and singing crappy football chants too loudly and so this cycle of stimulation and deflation the boom and bust of getting and having but still wanting more continues the desire and eny screw keeps ratcheting up and no end ever seems in sight so you just focus in on the next shiny thing you keep consuming in hopes that one day you'll have your fill and you can relax in your private pool in your private Villa somewhere away from all the Riff Raff showing Picture Perfect photos of yourself making everyone else envious in the West in particular this has become the societal Norm a feature maybe even a requisite of unrestrained capitalism this has led to some pretty malign results from a societal perspective with ever Rising rates of anxiety depression and other mental illnesses which have become an epidemic of discontent Despair and self-loathing no one's quite sure what to do about it I tried to do my bit to alleviate the symptoms of this societal dysfunction and I guess the causes too that's why this podcast exists it's why I tend to be painfully open about my struggles with mental illness it's good to talk and it's good to share it's also good to create and I hope this podcast encourages people to create and helps them do so as per the call thesis of this podcast I believe the Act of Creation is one of the most effective means of treatment and prevention of mental illness and one of the main reasons I think this is precisely because it helps with reliev some of the pressure of this Perma hostile environment the processes at work that lead us to these unhealthy Cycles are the same ones that can actually reprieve us from them we can blame big business technology social media celebrities and capitalism for all this but the root of it is in your head driven by complex Machinery designed to Keep Us Alive in a complex Peril filled world if you understand a little about that Machinery it might help you understand why these destructive Cycles exist it also gives us a clue about how to tackle them so as much as I've yapped on here about the therapeutic value of the creative process I've said very little about why I believe this is the case therefore I'm going to delve a little into psychology neuroscience and Physiology to try and explain how this all fits together why we get mentally ill and how creativity helps remedy and prevent this I'll put this in the context of other approaches to managing mental health and I'll try not to get too in the weeds because weeds there are lots of them now big dis disclaimer I'm not a psychology psychiatric or medical professional I have informally studied these areas quite a bit in my quest to understand my own brain but I'm far from an expert everything I say here should be taken with a level of caution and should in no way be taken to constitute advice that said I'm going to try and be as accurate as possible if any of this resonates then please go do your own research and or consult on medical professional before taking any action if you are the latter and you spot anything inaccurate or misleading in here then feel free to drop me a line and let me know and I'll Endeavor to set things straight right enough of disclaimers on with a show when we think of the human mind we think of it as a computer perhaps of a ghost in the machine called the soul but we're going to sidestep that debate for the moment this computer takes in information about the world around us via our senses decides how to react to whatever new information is coming in and sends signals to the rest of our body to take some sort of action so when you R the corner on your way to the shop to pick up some milk and see a tiger malevolently staring you down your brain tells your body to flee back from whence you came hoping frantically that someone more tasty looking passes its eyeline before it gives Chase to you a very logical course of action given the circumstances on the other hand especially when it comes to interactions with other humans and to an extent the animal kingdom the experience of the brain's functions appear fundamentally emotional and not like a computer at all so when rounding the same Corner the next day you see condescending Cara An Almighty gatekeeper of tast and decorum has spotted you and is traversing the road for today's barrage of passive aggression you feel suddenly panicked especially since you left the house in your sofa close part of your brain is telling you to run away just like when you spotted the tiger which isn't so logical these two characterizations of the brain seem are odds on one hand mechanical and logical on the other hand emotional and sometimes irrational these two aspects of the brain aren't separate at all they're part of the same set of processes they're just different aspects of the same machine think of it like say a camera which both takes photos and displays them you can either think of them as separate functions or just part of the requisite functionality of the device we are not a computer sitting on top of a doing machine like a human driving a car the thinking machine we call the brain is simply the main component of a complex thinking feeling doing machine we call the nervous system so when condescending Karen traverses the road and you feel the general sense of unease and Mild Panic a complex stream of processes are at work driven by a machine that sees its primary process as keeping you alive and well and free of conversations with self-important school moms the nervous system is usually very good at this but sometimes like any machine it goes wrong mostly this happens briefly as we react to the everchanging world around us but sometimes it goes wrong and stays wrong for long periods when this happens we experience what is known as mental illness a term that encompasses a broader Weare of conditions but for the purposes of this conversation a assum I'm referring to the category of mental illnesses that mainly affects emotions such as anxiety depression Panic all that fun stuff it's worth getting a bit technical for a bit and Define some terms and Concepts that we'll be referring to quite a bit for the rest of this and future episodes don't worry I'm going to try and keep things at a high level the nervous system is a complex biological Network responsible for bodily functions processing information and allowing communication between different parts of the body the central nervous Sy system which includes the brain and the spinal cord and the peripheral nervous system which connects the central nervous system to the rest of the body the autonomic nervous system is part of the peripheral nervous system that controls involuntary functions such as heart rate and digestion it has two main branches the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system it's these two we're primarily interested in the sympathetic nervous system is often called the fight ORF flight system It prepares the body to respond to threats it boosts heart rate and redirects blood to muscles mainly through the release of noradrenaline and adrenaline this helps us react quickly in stressful situations such as a tiger incident it's the don't think just do system on the other hand the sympathetic nervous system promotes relaxation and Recovery sometimes known as the rest and digest system it slows heart rate and enhances digestion together sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems maintain balance in the body this state of balance balance is sometimes called homeostasis a word that's derived from Greek and translates roughly to the same as standing still this is a term I'm going to refer to quite a lot paradoxically given that many mental health issues arise from our cognition the thoughts that we think conditions such as chronic anxiety and depression happen when your autonomic nervous system the non-thinking bit gets stuck in panic mode states of Affairs that we are aware of cause malfunctions in systems that we're largely not aware of but the ultimate cause of this mental malays is what I call bad homeostasis your autonomic nervous system can't balance itself to understand why this happens we need to introduce what will become a very familiar term neurochemicals most specifically neurotransmitters and hormones the things that we refer to as nerves are actually called neurons these are the wires of the nervous system transmitting signals using electrical impulses throughout the brain and body when a signal reach is the end of a neuron it releases chemicals called neurotransmitters these neurotransmitters cross tiny gaps known as synapses to communicate with other neurons influencing everything from movements and senses to our moods thoughts and behaviors for instance serotonin helps regulate mood while dopamine is linked to pleasure and reward and acetal Coline AIDS movement what I've actually done thus far and we continue doing is mixing up neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine and hormones such as oxy tocin for the purposes of this conversation the difference doesn't really matter since the nervous system runs on impulses transmitted by brain chemicals those chemicals play a pivotal role in the working or lack thereof of the nervous system depending on what's going on in your environment different neurochemicals are created and released that trigger physical and emotional reactions so when you're being chased by that tiger you've got lots of the neurochemicals adrenaline and noradrenaline exciting all the functions associated with prioritizing fight or flight such as heart rate alertness deprioritizing digestion and triggering your body's cooling system and you start to sweat to simplify perhaps grossly but in service of getting my main point across the neurochemicals come in two flavors those that rev us up sometimes called stimulant such as dopamine adrenaline and noradrenaline and those that chill us out such as serotonin and Gamma amino butic acid AKA Gaba I say this is a gross simplification because the purpose and action of these chemicals is complex and each one has various purposes in addition to their effect on mood and behavior for example serotonin plays a role in digestion their actions may also affect people differently for example for folks like me with ADHD supplementing our level of the stimulant dopamine via medication or drinking coffee can actually make us drowsy and lethargic the opposite to the way it affects most people this is because dopamine is implicated in our reward seeking behaviors ADHD brains like mine lack or poorly regulate dopamine and therefore ADHD people are constantly seeking rewards usually via stimulating situations or activities when you give us dopamine this emulates getting that reward and we can finally chill out having larger doses of dopamine however will put us in the same double speed mode similarly to everyone else all mood altering drugs do their thing by altering the amounts and actions of the chemicals in our bodies this includes coffee which increases dopamine and reduces the sleep hormone adenosine speed which increases dopamine and noradrenaline alcohol Alters dopamine and Gaba levels and acid which among other things boost serotonin in those times when you're not being chased by a murderous feliner or Eid up to the eyeballs at a rave your body's job is to keep all these chemicals in an optimal balance homeostasis but it's not always able to do this and sometimes this equilibrium gets completely disrupted so imagine if condescending Caren followed your around all day drining on about how smart her darling Gucci adorned offspring are just once or twice a week would be just about bearable but constantly she's not a threat per se but you're constantly on edge when you're with her in case you say something wrong and suddenly all the other parents are giving you funny looks since she's always lurking your sympathetic nervous system is rarely disengaged even when you find moments of Peace your nervous system can't fully recover when fight or flight is triggered your body releases a hormone called cortisol which is sometimes called the stress hormone this is a hormone responsible for putting your body in panic mode it takes a while for cortisol clear from your system therefore if you get stressed again too soon after getting a break you never really wind down anxiety breeds anxiety and fight or flight mode makes you hyper aware of threats which means you start to see them everywhere a comment someone makes an unusual meeting call at work a strange pain in your belly this in turn causes your body to release yet more cortisol if you can't get a proper break you can get stuck in anxiety Doom Loop so even if Karen Retreats permanently to our gated community you may not be able to break the cycle this is when chronic anxiety in depression rear their ugly heads this is why sometimes call these illnesses bad homeostasis your nervous system has lost its ability to reassert the equilibrium it's usually so good at maintaining the Cent situation is a little contrived although I'm sure we all know someone like that but it's really just a metaphor for more common situations that lead to these bad outcomes you may have a patronizing acquaintance but maybe it's sustained stress at work illness of a loved one a new baby it doesn't have to be something life-changing either a Noisy Neighbor a broken leg not being able to do some activity that you love this can all cause your system to go Haywire if experienced over a long period for us autistics just dealing with day-to-day activities and routine human interactions tends to set off our fight ORF flight response therefore we are considerably more prone to these types of stress related chronic conditions one of the reasons these conditions are so widespread relates to the theme that I started this episode off by talking about societal pressures and the anxieties these caus are nothing new but thanks to the more recent technological advances they are much more present and more problematically they are pretty much perpetually present this is exactly like Karen following you around everywhere every time your phone chirps you get a little dopamine bump and you log in to see what's happening you find yourself on Facebook or insta or Snapchat and Society Karen and all her sycophantic cronies elbow in this is of course purely figurative but that's not how your subconscious sees it no one well hopefully no one is peering back out at you but you feel seen observed but since most people never turn off or leave the presence of their phone this feeling never goes away we're not designed for this our homes are a refuge because that's where we Shelter From the day-to-day dramas and etiquette of society it's somewhere where you can wear something comfortable but ugly forgo any sort of Grooming lifea on the couch and watch Adam Sandler movies Society doesn't belong here but there it is leaking out at you from a little glowing rectangle therefore you never really relax that respite is not a luxury most of us simply can't function without it having your phone constantly there is like deliberately putting grit in your bed this is bad enough when the constant imposition is just passive but particularly among younger Generations this impingment goes far beyond day-to-day dramas into direct and unavoidable harassment sometimes with tragic consequences smartphones have so many benefits but it's becoming increasingly clear that those benefits are more than balanced by their downsides if you find yourself suffering from chronic anxiety Then that little rectangle is not likely to be much comfort and many of the people that allows to ped into your life will be less than sympathetic about your plight not everyone understands or is willing to have sympathy especially when they're on the other end of a wire mental illness is just like any other type of illness it has causes and treatments however there's no pervasive stigma around mental illness that seeks to make us believe it's all imagined and therefore the sufferer can pull themselves together snap out of it or cheer up but mental illness is never imagined and people can't just pull themselves together any more than someone with dentry can just get on with eating and give the toilet a break once you've got yourself some bad homeostasis how do you return to equilibrium how do you treat mental illness it's outside the scope of this podcast and my expertise to go into any great depths here all I really want to do is talk about why the major forms of treatment work in the broadest possible sense because it gives us a clue as to why art is such a valuable therapeutic Pursuit for our purposes I'm going to break down the treatments into some very broad groups number one medicines number two talking therapies number three physical exercise number four mindfulness and number five activity based therapies I'm deliberately not covering the more invasive or extreme medical interventions for more profound or debilitating ing disorders such as electroshock therapy and I'm steering clear of alternative medicines that have little to no basis in scientific research I'm not discounting these on premise but until they have a little more evidence behind them they can't be considered effective treatments whereas the rest of them do and can I also recognize that there are varying degrees of skepticism about some of these especially anti-depressants and mindfulness even within the medical and scientific communities but I'm going to stick with the mainstream scientific views here not least because doing so backs up my core thesis if you want to debate this stuff feel free to do so with the next Medical Professional you meet so onwards when we think about mood altering drugs we think of often illegal substances that make us feel good often accompanied with less desirable effects like dependency physical ailments and death that might be the case with cocaine but the stuff used to treat anxiety and depression doesn't really work like that despite working along similar lines to understand how they work you need to go back to our bad homeostasis caus by sustained stress scenario imagine the pipe in your kitchen is sprung a major gushing leak and is spewing water all over your kitchen floor you've got no Plumbing skills and no idea that the concept of a stop even exists let alone where to find it you're able to hold back the flood somewhat by putting a bucket under the offending pipe but it fills up with water in a matter of seconds you don't even have time to call your dad to ask for advice or to call an emergency plumber you just need a break so that you can take some proper action without completely destroying your kitchen then you have an idea you remember that if you have two or more Taps running in your house at the same time they'll run down to a trickle that's usually annoying especially when having a shower but it proves to be a Gods right now you rush to the bathroom and turn on all the Taps as well as a shower when you return to the kitchen the leak is still ejecting water but now at a much slower rate and so you now only have to empty the bucket once every few minutes sure you're wasting water but at least now you have time to make some calls and fix things maybe that will take no time or maybe you'll end up hauling the water for another couple of hours until help arrives but at least you're able to deal with it when you fall into one of these spiraling self- perpetuating Doom Loops your body and brain tend to spend all their free time and energy dealing with that like the gushing pipe most treatments are less like an experienced plumber simply locating the stopcock and more like the scenario outlined above you do have the psychological Machinery to get better but it's fully engaged in the act of trying and failing to prevent things getting worse What treatments like medications do is buy that psychological space to attempt to fix the real problem the most common type of anti-depressants are ssris selective serotonin reuptake Inhibitors such as Prozac AKA fluoxitine and caline I won't go into the specific mechanisms of how these work but they increase the levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain which in turn has a calming effect you don't feel good when you take them in fact you barely feel anything at all but over weeks and months they take just enough pressure off your embattled nervous system that it can divert some resources to gaining that much needed homeostasis while this is happening in the background your constant panicking and anxious rumination subside and you feel generally more calm and start to see the world through more rational eyes if external factors are responsible for getting you into this state for example you lost your job and have been struggling to find a new one then this psychological headro will make it easier for you to take on that task the source of your trouble hasn't gone away but you're in much better shape to deal with it and deal with it you should if you possibly can because medication can only do so much and many people relapse when they come off these medications not because they didn't work or because they're doomed to suffer as humans but because they are only ever there to tackle the symptoms if the cause Still Remains and you've done nothing to ameliorate it then your illness May well return it's like visiting a house of cats while being allergic to cat fur you can take antihistamine but if you don't leave that house you'll be sneezing again as soon as they wear off so if both elicit and prescribed substances alter your brain chemistry then why not just go out score some coke and get smashed there are a few reasons why this is not a good idea as fun as it might sound and perhaps B we'll sidestep the obvious legal problems which I think are obvious enough to go without saying and stick with the inevitable side effects so one of the main treatments for ADHD is dexamphetamine the more socially liberal of you out there might have spotted that that sounds very much like the formal name for the party drug known as speed you know the one that L me from motad Mainline and students use to get themselves through exams and you would be right they're basically the same I'm prescribed decks to manage ADHD which basically means I go to the pharmacy every month and pick up a big bag of pills that have serious street value yes I could in theory get off my nut on the stuff but I don't because it would just make things worse Dex only has the effect that it does to allow me to focus and take the edge off the constant need for stimulation in small controlled doses in fact most forms of ADHD stimulant medications are prescribed as slow release pills that yield small amounts of the drug throughout the day ensuring that a it can't be abused and B you get the requisite dose drip fed it's still possible to take too much which generally makes me feel crap it's similar to drinking too many espressos and gives me brutal downs and that's exactly the problem with taking high doses of mood altering drugs you get into a boom bus cycle that tends to spiral as you need more of the drug to account for the comedowns making the next come down even worse and so on anything that increases dopamine as part of its effect is also potentially addictive and we all know where that leads there are also various other side effects that only increase with higher doses so even though some of these drugs can be abused it's always counterproductive the same applies to stuff like alcohol and caffeine which are arguably even harder to manage the illegal stuff comes with a whole bunch of other perils such as not knowing what's actually in it having to deal with drug dealers illegality unpredictable Supply differences in quality and strength high cost high risk of overdose or poisoning etc etc don't do it kides it ain't worth it I'm getting sidetracked but since I'm talking about mind altering drugs I figured I'd better put some guard rails in so where does that leave us we now see that nervous system is among other things tasked with the business of managing our emotional and physical equilibrium and that when that equilibrium is persistently unbalanced we get bad homeostasis which manifests as mental illness we can take medication to help with this but there are other methods we can use to treat it and help maintain our equilibrium that's what we're going to talk about in the next episode in this series we might even get to talking about art again so biology lesson over kides please proceed in an orderly fashion to the playground and remember be nice to each other and while you're there since you're going to be glowing your little glowing rectangle anyway instead of Doom scrolling why not leave a rating in a review of this podcast on wherever you're listening to it and if you do end up on social tell your friends to come and have a listen to see you soon
