## Core Thesis Statements

### Primary Podcast Mission
> "as per the call thesis of this podcast I believe the Act of Creation is one of the most effective means of treatment and prevention of mental illness and one of the main reasons I think this is precisely because it helps with reliev some of the pressure of this Perma hostile environment"

### Root Cause Analysis
> "we can blame big business technology social media celebrities and capitalism for all this but the root of it is in your head driven by complex Machinery designed to Keep Us Alive in a complex Peril filled world if you understand a little about that Machinery it might help you understand why these destructive Cycles exist it also gives us a clue about how to tackle them"

## Mental Health Framework

### Bad Homeostasis Definition
> "conditions such as chronic anxiety and depression happen when your autonomic nervous system the non-thinking bit gets stuck in panic mode states of Affairs that we are aware of cause malfunctions in systems that we're largely not aware of but the ultimate cause of this mental malays is what I call bad homeostasis your autonomic nervous system can't balance itself"

### Mental Illness Reality
> "mental illness is just like any other type of illness it has causes and treatments however there's no pervasive stigma around mental illness that seeks to make us believe it's all imagined and therefore the sufferer can pull themselves together snap out of it or cheer up but mental illness is never imagined and people can't just pull themselves together any more than someone with dentry can just get on with eating and give the toilet a break"

## Modern Society Critique

### Consumer Culture Cycle
> "so you go eat a big burger you go get smashed out of your skull in a pub you go on holiday to the south of Spain where you spend all your time looking at your phone only to find that your best friends on holiday in the SE shells or climbing Mount Everest or something equally enviable or impressive so there you are experiencing the very thing that you craved yet feeling it a deficit"

### Perpetual Comparison
> "this perceived social imbalance causes us to be constantly alert to our status in the world what we have and what we don't things we do and things we don't how people view US For Better or For Worse it comes as an almost uninterrupted stream via little glowing rectangles that we keep in our pockets or bags this tends to leave us with the feeling that we're missing something or lacking something all the time"

### Technology's Impact
> "this is exactly like Karen following you around everywhere every time your phone chirps you get a little dopamine bump and you log in to see what's happening you find yourself on Facebook or insta or Snapchat and Society Karen and all her sycophantic cronies elbow in"

> "our homes are a refuge because that's where we Shelter From the day-to-day dramas and etiquette of society it's somewhere where you can wear something comfortable but ugly forgo any sort of Grooming lifea on the couch and watch Adam Sandler movies Society doesn't belong here but there it is leaking out at you from a little glowing rectangle therefore you never really relax"

> "having your phone constantly there is like deliberately putting grit in your bed"

## Scientific Explanations

### Brain as Integrated System
> "we are not a computer sitting on top of a doing machine like a human driving a car the thinking machine we call the brain is simply the main component of a complex thinking feeling doing machine we call the nervous system"

### Stress Response Mechanism
> "if you can't get a proper break you can get stuck in anxiety Doom Loop so even if Karen Retreats permanently to our gated community you may not be able to break the cycle this is when chronic anxiety in depression rear their ugly heads this is why sometimes call these illnesses bad homeostasis your nervous system has lost its ability to reassert the equilibrium it's usually so good at maintaining"

### Medication as Temporary Relief
> "What treatments like medications do is buy that psychological space to attempt to fix the real problem... you don't feel good when you take them in fact you barely feel anything at all but over weeks and months they take just enough pressure off your embattled nervous system that it can divert some resources to gaining that much needed homeostasis"

## Personal/Autobiographical Elements

### ADHD Experience
> "for folks like me with ADHD supplementing our level of the stimulant dopamine via medication or drinking coffee can actually make us drowsy and lethargic the opposite to the way it affects most people this is because dopamine is implicated in our reward seeking behaviors ADHD brains like mine lack or poorly regulate dopamine and therefore ADHD people are constantly seeking rewards usually via stimulating situations or activities when you give us dopamine this emulates getting that reward and we can finally chill out"

### Prescription Drug Reality
> "one of the main treatments for ADHD is dexamphetamine the more socially liberal of you out there might have spotted that that sounds very much like the formal name for the party drug known as speed you know the one that L me from motad Mainline and students use to get themselves through exams and you would be right they're basically the same I'm prescribed decks to manage ADHD which basically means I go to the pharmacy every month and pick up a big bag of pills that have serious street value"

### Autism and Stress
> "for us autistics just dealing with day-to-day activities and routine human interactions tends to set off our fight ORF flight response therefore we are considerably more prone to these types of stress related chronic conditions"

## Treatment Philosophy

### Medication Limitations
> "if external factors are responsible for getting you into this state for example you lost your job and have been struggling to find a new one then this psychological headro will make it easier for you to take on that task the source of your trouble hasn't gone away but you're in much better shape to deal with it and deal with it you should if you possibly can because medication can only do so much"

> "it's like visiting a house of cats while being allergic to cat fur you can take antihistamine but if you don't leave that house you'll be sneezing again as soon as they wear off"

### Why Recreation Drugs Don't Work
> "anything that increases dopamine as part of its effect is also potentially addictive and we all know where that leads there are also various other side effects that only increase with higher doses so even though some of these drugs can be abused it's always counterproductive"

## Memorable Metaphors and Analogies

### The Burst Pipe Metaphor
> "imagine the pipe in your kitchen is sprung a major gushing leak and is spewing water all over your kitchen floor you've got no Plumbing skills and no idea that the concept of a stop even exists let alone where to find it you're able to hold back the flood somewhat by putting a bucket under the offending pipe but it fills up with water in a matter of seconds... you remember that if you have two or more Taps running in your house at the same time they'll run down to a trickle"

### Camera Analogy for Brain
> "these two aspects of the brain aren't separate at all they're part of the same set of processes they're just different aspects of the same machine think of it like say a camera which both takes photos and displays them you can either think of them as separate functions or just part of the requisite functionality of the device"

### The Tiger vs Karen Scenarios
> "when you R the corner on your way to the shop to pick up some milk and see a tiger malevolently staring you down your brain tells your body to flee back from whence you came hoping frantically that someone more tasty looking passes its eyeline before it gives Chase to you a very logical course of action given the circumstances"

> "when rounding the same Corner the next day you see condescending Cara An Almighty gatekeeper of tast and decorum has spotted you and is traversing the road for today's barrage of passive aggression you feel suddenly panicked especially since you left the house in your sofa close part of your brain is telling you to run away just like when you spotted the tiger which isn't so logical"

## Voice and Tone Examples

### Conversational Authority
> "right enough of disclaimers on with a show"

### Self-Deprecating Humor
> "don't do it kides it ain't worth it I'm getting sidetracked but since I'm talking about mind altering drugs I figured I'd better put some guard rails in"

### Educational Conclusion
> "so biology lesson over kides please proceed in an orderly fashion to the playground and remember be nice to each other"
