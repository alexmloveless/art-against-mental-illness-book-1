## Core Philosophy on Art and Politics

> "I'd argue that arts relationship to current affairs and politics is increasingly relevant, not just relevant but essential and urgent"

> "Those with totalitarian leanings don't tend to like being critiqued and most see the arts as their natural enemy along with protest and free speech."

> "Artists and creators tend to be quite high on the empathy scale and because of this we recognize and reflect the cultural undercurrents of human society and therefore not only do despots see the arts themselves as a threat they also see artists as a group of people who are inherently opposed to their ideology."

> "Despots crave a certain kind of order one where everything points towards them and their bloated ego. The scent is a dirty smudge on the clean, orderly world they crave and therefore must be extinguished"

## Social Function of Arts

> "A functional society needs the arts. It may not be that everyone in society appreciates the arts equally but you'll be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't watch tv or movies or youtube or play games or listen to music"

> "And if you constrain the arts you constrain what people can do and say. You're by definition constraining creativity and freedom expression."

## Mental Health and Arts

> "Being able to channel my fear and frustration into artworks is a vital cathartic release and shelter from the constant barrage of bad news."

> "For all of us such a refuge can provide the vital breathing space to recharge so that we may resume the fight revitalized."

> "So ultimately restricting the arts leads to a less healthy society both physically and psychologically and if you want your society to be optimally functional then you need them to be healthy and happy and therefore the arts need to be available and unconstrained."

## Art as Defiance

> "To quote German poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht, art is not a mirror held up to society but a hammer with which to shape it."

> "Whether your art is explicitly political or purely aesthetic your freedom of expression to choose what to represent and how is a reinforcement of liberty and a middle finger up to tyrants."

> "Next time you find some space for creativity or when you find yourself experiencing some great art which is basically constantly remember this in itself it is an act of defiance. Defiance of the status quo and the defiance of all those who seek to perpetuate the status quo for their own malignant ends."

> "Artist change be the change."

## Podcast Philosophy

> "Most of the most pervasive and destructive problems we observe in the world at the moment which includes epidemic and endemic mental illness is division. It's less about left versus right and liberal versus conservative and more about a lack of communication, mutual understanding, empathy, community and shared goals."

> "If you bring people together they talk. If you guide people to the act of creation the solace they find in it will help them be more open-minded and empathetic to the world. A few more mentally healthy people in the world can't be a bad thing right?"
