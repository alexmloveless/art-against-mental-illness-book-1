Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. I tend to stay away from current affairs on this podcast.
Well I have done thus far but it's not because I don't pay attention to such things or because I
don't think it's relevant to the subject. I think the events in the world around us are deeply
relevant to both arts and mental health. With the world in the state that it's in at the moment,
two brutal wars and what just happened in the good old US of A, I'm recording this the day
after the American election that saw Donald Trump win his second term in office. I'd argue that
arts relationship to current affairs and politics is increasingly relevant, not just relevant but
essential and urgent, which is what I want to talk about in this episode. The level of ambient
anxiety all this global instability causes is not particularly good for my mental health.
At times like these I try to screen out the news since it stresses me out and I have little control
over it. For example, I'm not American and I didn't get to vote in that election despite the
fact that a Trump victory would and now will likely affect the security of my country.
I don't think I'm alone in wanting to open my phone on a daily basis and scream into it.
Give me some good news for God's sake. Although I'm sure Google Assistant would oblige were I to
do so, I dread to think what it might dredge up. This instability is affecting the mental health
of many people and this being a podcast aimed at improving mental health, it would seem a little
irresponsible to knowingly inflict stuff on my listeners that I know is likely to harm their
mental health. But I also can't ignore it completely because if art does anything, it holds a mirror up
to the world, to society, to culture and reflects what it sees, which is sometimes beautiful and
sometimes hideous. So I'm going to talk about a few facets of the arts and their interface with
current affairs, society and politics. I'm going to try not to get sucked into specifics of what's
going on right now or soapbox on my political views, but inevitably I'll have to make some
references to real events here and there and my opinions are likely to leak out even if only
latently. So consider this your content warning. If you really don't want a reminder of the nutso
state of the world, skip this episode and maybe go listen to my calming tones on one of my other
episodes. So here goes. I deleted my twitter account I guess maybe a year ago. I think just
before it got mutated, hulk-like into its malignant and incessantly angry twin, X, after it was bought
by king goblin, Elon Musk. That 10 events is what finally triggered me to delete my account,
but I'd realized long before that I needed to stay off that platform, regardless of what it was called
or who owned it. Because it's like crack to my brain, I just get sucked in. The algorithm is
designed perfectly to mesmerize my ADHD brain, feeding me dopamine via little packets of outrage.
I've heard it said that arguments are full of dopamine and as much as I loathe conflict,
my dopamine starved brain will take its fix anywhere I can get it. Twitter stroke X is just
one big argument these days, a stockpot of outrage and bile that's always teetering on the threshold
of boiling over. To varying degrees it always was. I used to get sucked into obsessively refreshing
my feed like a chicken pecking at its food and finding myself constantly tense and angry but
still hitting refresh and getting annoyed when the algorithm wasn't feeding me anything new.
There had been times when I've entirely deleted the app from my phone and actually put blockers
on my home network so I couldn't access it, but I still couldn't bring myself to actually delete
my account because I had convinced myself that I needed it so I could promote my art for my job,
to keep abreast of fast moving events, FOMO, the creeping insidious fear that if I did so I would
be irreconcilably severed from the rest of the world to fester in abject solitude. I was like
an alcoholic in recovery having a secret stash of vodka and an unmarked bottle at the back of the
larder just in case. But the elongated muskrats antics compelled me to finally kick the habit
and I downloaded my history and said goodbye to the trollverse. I haven't looked back and despite
the fact that my mental health remains at best variable at least I've removed one source of
anxiety and negative feeling and that's good. But here's the thing, I'm going to get angry anyway.
It's kind of hard to avoid the news especially at the moment given everything that's going on.
I avoid the news but then I fire up one of my favourite podcasts and here's an advert for some
current affairs show or whatever and I'm dragged right back kicking and screaming into that world.
I don't like a lot of what's going on and I feel somewhat powerless. Not completely powerless. I
can choose where I direct my eyeballs, where I spend my money and how I use my vote, although
the opportunity to do the latter is probably five years away in the UK. But really there's
relatively little I can do to affect the macro world situation. But I can talk, I can run this
podcast and I can attempt to enrich the lives of people around me to the better and I can make art.
Instead of venting my Spleen Vi 100 or whatever characters I can retreat to my studio and Spleen
vent onto a canvas. It's an escape route where I can either simply ignore the world and or channel
my reactions into an artwork. I create paintings that are parcels of escapism both for me and
hopefully for the viewer. Some of my works from about five or six years ago around the time of
Brexit in the UK were either overtly or covertly political. I would weave in cutting some newspapers
and bits of social media and magazines and stuff and I would have collages with some themed pictures
over the top of them taken from a movie or whatever to make some point about the state of things.
I was making slightly clumsy but heartfelt comments about the absurdity of the world around me.
I incorporated images of political figures who I found repellent. This for me is partly at least
an exorcism of demons by depicting and making fun and critiquing these people who I disagree with on
almost a molecular level. It takes the place of me ranting and raving and moaning and boring and
baiting those around me. It feels like I'm doing something positive or at least something. Whether
or not these messages will reach anyone or whether or not people understand or interpret these works
as I intended them and if they could whether it would at all affect their opinion on any of these
matters I don't know. I doubt it. Some of my motivation here is to make a statement so I can
say in the medium that I'm comfortable with I'm not okay with this and to connect with people who
are also not okay with this. If I can change someone's mind on a subject then great but I
strongly suspect that this almost never happens and it's pretty well understood in psychology that
is usually counterproductive in terms of trying to win people over to your argument.
Art is a medium for communication and therefore that's what I'm doing and I'd rather show someone
something that I made that they can appreciate and enjoy while also containing a message than
getting on a podcast and ranting about the state of the world. I'm certainly not alone in using my
chosen artistic medium to express my dissatisfaction. Picasso, responsible for perhaps the most famous
piece of political or protest art before Banksy turned up, the Guernica stated that art is a lie
that makes us realize the truth. He's saying that by making fictional things we highlight real things
in the real world. His famous and giant painting was a comment on the horrors of the Spanish Civil
War which in his words clearly expresses my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk
Spain into an ocean of pain and death. The history of protest art is at best diffuse but examples of
it have been traced back to ancient Egypt. More recent early examples can be found in the likes
of Francisco Goya's series of 82 print depicting the horrors of the peninsula war with terrifying
unflinching honesty in the early 19th century but it was in the 20th century that protest art really
became a cultural force. From the anonymous feminist activism of the guerrilla girls through
Keith Herring's vibrant, pythol but deadly serious graffiti to Pussy Riot's very public displays of
performative, punkish discontent. About his 1917 work The Funeral, German expressionist George Gross
said, in a strange treat by night a hellish procession of dehumanized figures mills, their
faces reflecting alcohol, syphilis and plague. I painted this protest against the humanity that had
gone insane. Chinese artist and exile Ai Weiwei dedicates his life and works almost entirely to
political protest and makes works across a dizzying array of styles and mediums including sculptural
installations, woodworking, video and photography. He stated that the world is not changing if you
don't shoulder the burden of responsibility. Grace and Perry's illustrated vases and other
knickknacks are elaborate narratives packed with rice social observation and political comment.
Jenny Savile's news wage war on society's warped expectations regarding the female form.
Music is awash with protest. Folk legend Woody Guthrie's guitar was adorned with the slogan
this machine kills fascists. Bob Dylan's early work, Billy Bragg, Donnie Mitchell, Bob Marley,
hardcore punk legends, minor threats, clean living polemicism, public enemies intimidating
black power, hip-hop, queen bays world conquering feminism, K10 pest poetic bile and beauty,
pink Floyd, rage against machine, lamb of god etc etc. In the movies we have Doctor Strange Love
on nuclear war, Dawn of the Dead takes aim at consumerism, Apocalypse Now on full metal jacket
on Vietnam and more recently Don't Look Up and Civil War turn their sights to modern day USA.
I don't even know where to start with literature. Orwell, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451,
Slaught House 5, Catch-22, Silent Spring, Handmaid's Tale, American Psycho, 50 Bloody Shades of Grey.
Many claim that Lord of the Rings, despite Tolkien's protestations to the contrary,
is awash with social commentary. I was going to TV, the stage performance art and so on but I
can't very well just sit here listing things now can I? Suffice to say that if you're under the
delusion that the arts should keep their nose out of society and politics then I'm afraid you're
going to be disappointed. And precisely because some people think such things the arts are so
important to the function of society. I don't have to look very far to see the evidence of those
seeking power to curtail the ability of the arts to critique them. The UK has seen huge cuts in
arts funding especially in schools over the last decade or two and even direct attacks on our
cultural institutions such as the National Trust, the BBC and Channel 4 although it is fair to say
that our film industry is booming. We see similar maneuvers in patches all across the world as
wannabe despots spring up all over the place. Those with totalitarian leanings don't tend to like
being critiqued and most see the arts as their natural enemy along with protest and free speech.
Because if people can hold a mirror up to society then you're also holding a mirror up to its
leaders. I don't think anyone regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum enjoys being
criticized but people who are truly democrats as in small d democrats understand that criticism,
free press, right to protest, right to criticize the government are essential for a functional
democracy in the correct course of action when criticized is to either change course or justify
your actions. As much as the luxury of freedom of expression is only somewhat afforded to us in the
UK, Europe and America there seems to have been a creeping view from the political extremes that
freedom of the arts and freedom of the press is not optimal for the society that they envision
coming about or in China and Russia's case that they wish to maintain. Artists and creators tend
to be quite high on the empathy scale and because of this we recognize and reflect the cultural
undercurrents of human society and therefore not only do despots see the arts themselves as a
threat they also see artists as a group of people who are inherently opposed to their ideology.
Despots crave a certain kind of order one where everything points towards them and their bloated
ego. The scent is a dirty smudge on the clean, orderly world they crave and therefore must be
extinguished so you lock up your critics and can tell the arts. One of the most important doctrines
in the fascist playbook. A functional society needs to be able to express itself, it wants to
be able to express itself and freely. We might be pack animals but there are a lot of packs out there
and they don't all want and need the same things. Therefore if you want society to fall neatly in
line you have to use force which is inevitably the way for tyrants but it's a hard regime to maintain
and fraught with pitfalls and most despotisms usually fail under the weight of their own
psychosis. Art is communication and the number one requirement for a functional despotism
is to control communication. I don't think many people would knowingly wish fascism upon themselves.
Yes the Nazis came to power democratically but I'm not sure the German people really knew what
they were getting themselves into. One way or another Hitler preyed on the desperation created
by the reparations to serve his own needs and created a big evil mess in the process.
Ultimately as the same member of a functional society you want people to feel free to express
themselves, to communicate because that's how humanity progresses, that's how culture evolves.
That's what's enabled innovation in technology, healthcare and entertainment that's made us safer
longer-lived with richer more varied lives. It's enabled some much less healthy stuff too
but that's for another day. A functional society needs the arts. It may not be that everyone
in society appreciates the arts equally but you'll be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't watch
tv or movies or youtube or play games or listen to music and so the arts do impact on everyone's life
to one degree or another even if they don't think of it that way. And if you constrain the arts you
constrain what people can do and say. You're by definition constraining creativity and freedom
expression. And yes of course there's certain areas that fundamentally shouldn't be allowed
because of the harm and horror they would afflict on the people who can't otherwise defend themselves
i.e. children. But in terms of just creating art that has a functional non-destructive role in
society you need creativity. People need fresh culture pretty much constantly. That's why people
turn up week after week to watch the next episode of their favorite soap, love island or the next
Mr Beast video because it's new, fresh. And enabling that needs creativity and freedom to express.
And the more you constrain that the less new things come about. So yes of course you can take
the same few chords on the guitar and create a huge number of different songs with them but
eventually that's going to sound stale and boring and monotonous and people will tune out and or
demand something different and new. At its most benign the arts provide solace and escape from
the wearying world for both the creator and the consumer. I know that that's the case for me.
It's not solely world affairs that erode my mental health but it's a major factor.
Being able to channel my fear and frustration into artworks is a vital cathartic release
and shelter from the constant barrage of bad news. For all of us such a refuge can provide
the vital breathing space to recharge so that we may resume the fight revitalized.
So ultimately restricting the arts leads to a less healthy society both physically and
psychologically and if you want your society to be optimally functional then you need them to be
healthy and happy and therefore the arts need to be available and unconstrained. So far from being
apolitical the arts are integral to societal stability not to mention the money they make for
those who create and the richness brought to people's lives because of them. Whether your art
is explicitly political or purely aesthetic your freedom of expression to choose what to represent
and how is a reinforcement of liberty and a middle finger up to tyrants. To quote German poet and
playwright Bertolt Brecht, art is not a mirror held up to society but a hammer with which to
shape it. Next time you find some space for creativity or when you find yourself experiencing
some great art which is basically constantly remember this in itself it is an act of defiance.
Defiance of the status quo and the defiance of all those who seek to perpetuate the status quo for
their own malignant ends. Artist change be the change. Okay okay I'm climbing down off my soapbox
now. I'll stay off it for a little while not least because I'm apoplectically sick of all of it.
It's making me so sad and tired but I should say that I'm not shy with expressing my political
views nor am I embarrassed by or ashamed of them and I doubt it's hard to either discover or infer
my political leanings but one of my key aims with this podcast and my artistic endeavors in general
is to bring people together to help them exchange ideas communicate empathize. If I use this channel
as a platform for broadcasting my political views all I will do is alienate large swathes
of people and what's that really achieving? Most of the most pervasive and destructive problems
we observe in the world at the moment which includes epidemic and endemic mental illness
is division. It's less about left versus right and liberal versus conservative and more about
a lack of communication, mutual understanding, empathy, community and shared goals. If you bring
people together they talk. If you guide people to the act of creation the solace they find in it
will help them be more open-minded and empathetic to the world. A few more mentally healthy people
in the world can't be a bad thing right? Right that's enough of that. Lots of fun stuff coming
up in future episodes. Part three of the How to Be Creative series will be about mastery and lack
thereof and there'll likely be a couple more in that series focusing on constraints and how ideas
come about. I've got an episode in the works on the physical aspects of mental illness and how
the act of creativity helps. I'm also attempting to line up my first interview episode. Watch this
