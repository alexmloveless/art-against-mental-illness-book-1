# Episode 6: Experimentation - Significant Quotes

## On Experimentation and Creative Process

### The Necessity of Experimentation
> "I think it's vitally important for the process of creation. And even if you are someone who does stay consistent, that has found their niche and their style and is happy within a certain realm, a medium, a subject, a style, a level of experimentation is still absolutely essential. Your work needs to evolve. It needs to be fresh. It needs to be fresh for you, and it needs to be fresh for your buyers, your fans, your admirers."

### The Danger of Goal-Oriented Creation
> "If what you're trying to do, if what you point yourself at is a specific goal, a specific outcome - I want to make watercolors like this person, I want to make oil paintings like Van Gogh, I want to make music like Radiohead, I want to write books like Norman Mailer - you are setting a funnel for yourself that's going inwards, that's pointing towards a particular point, and is going to lead you very quickly into the realms of disappointment, procrastination, and perfectionism. This is not a good place to be if what you want to do is experience the therapeutic value of art."

### The Magic of Practice Moments
> "That moment where you're laying down another scale over and over again, where you're practicing the same piece of music, where you can just suddenly meander off and find some creativity in your repetitions and your movements and your muscle memory, where you can lose yourself in the music. That little trigger, that little extra thing that allowed you to meander off and do something different - these are the most important parts of the creative process."

## On Personal Creative Identity

### ADHD and Artistic Consistency
> "I think it comes very much from the ADHD side of my personality. I tend to jump from one thing to another because I get my energy from starting things. I get my energy from novelty, and so I don't restrain that because when I try and follow a particular thread stylistically or thematically, I get bored. And then when I get bored, I get depressed. And when I get depressed, all sorts of bad things happen to me and those around me, and it's not a nice place to be."

### The Commercial Dilemma
> "I face the problem of doing that. I would destroy my mental health and the therapeutic value of the artistic creative process for me, at least. And that poses a dilemma because I know I can produce high-quality consistent work. I just know that it will also destroy me."

### Art vs. Money
> "Art for me is and never has been about making money anyway, but I could really do with it earning me a bit of cash right now."

## On Studio and Sacred Space

### The Therapeutic Ritual
> "Earlier today I was tidying up my studio. It's a ritual I go through - you might have heard me mention it a couple of episodes ago. I do this when I'm feeling stuck or down and I need something to help me break the impasse and to feel a bit more positive. A tidy studio has such a rejuvenative effect on me."

### Loss of Studio (Post-Recording Update)
> "I don't have my studio anymore - my lovely studio which I've made so much my own and has become my place of peace and serenity and happiness for the last couple of years. I have to surrender it. Hopefully its new owner will treat it as nicely as I did."

## On Failure and Learning

### The Value of Failed Experiments
> "I always keep old canvases. I don't throw away bits of paper that I've cut off things. I don't throw away old drawings or sketches that I didn't like or I didn't think were good enough to share. I keep them all, and I keep them all in piles around the place. Every now and again when I need a bit of inspiration, I go and sort through them and have a look at what's there."

### Experimentation's Cumulative Effect
> "Experimentation then isn't just about taking a different approach and then producing something magical, because most of the time you won't. And maybe most of the time it won't have a huge effect on your main body of work. But it will be there, it will have some effect, and it will have given you that feeling of freedom and lightness and that feeling that you can be creative."

## On Technique and Method

### Canvas Preparation Technique
> "One of my favorite things to do is to take a blank canvas and then just abuse it - drip things on it, splatter things on it, smear it, create texture - knowing what I'm going to put on that canvas after, not because I think that that's going to improve my duplication of some image that I found that I want to depict, but precisely the opposite. Because it will make it hard. Because it will mean that I have to think differently about how I create that image."

### Creating Jumping-Off Points
> "You need to create little jumping-off points. You need to create disruptions to that flow that force you to think differently, that force you to act differently. And it doesn't matter if those things that you do don't add up to anything."

## On Authenticity and Self-Expression

### True Authenticity
> "There's a lot of talk about being authentic, which I think is in many cases nonsensical and focuses on being someone else's version of authentic. If you want to be authentic to yourself, you just need to let yourself flow. You need to go wherever you want to go, how you want to go there, at a time and in a place where you're allowed to do that and no one can criticize you."

### The Requirement for Freedom
> "For the therapeutic value of art to really work, you need to be able to feel that you can be whoever you want to be, uninterrupted and unencumbered, and to lean into the person you are."

### Finding Your Own Path
> "You need to find your own path, however that is. And you do that by experimentation, not by doggedly pushing against the same door. And you can only do that if you can do it by being free of the possibility of criticism."

## On Mental Health and Creative Purpose

### The Therapeutic Balance
> "As long as you're enjoying that process, that's what's important. And so you need to look for the moments that take you away from your path."

### Process Over Product
> "Interestingly, it sort of doesn't matter if what you're making is wonderful, as long as you're enjoying it, as long as you allow yourself the brevity and the freedom to go and do something different, to experiment, to take yourself off into a different area than where you started off."

### The Necessity of Relaxation
> "Until you are able to feel like you can be yourself and express yourself, you're not going to be able to relax. And relaxing, leaning into the process, is the important thing."

## On Radiohead as Creative Model

### Taking Creative Risks
> "Whether you think that they were good risks, whether you think they made good art, there is absolutely no doubt that they took huge risks when they did that. And those risks paid off in spades and allowed them even more creative freedom."

### The Privilege of Experimentation
> "I recognize they were in a fairly privileged position. Their first album, despite being pretty crap, sold a lot and they had the backing of a major label with lots of money who were willing to let them experiment, and most of us aren't in that position."

## On Personal Crisis and Vulnerability

### Financial Fear
> "I've got a mortgage, I've got a family, and I'm fast running out of money. And I'm genuinely in fear of losing my house and becoming unemployed for the long term."

### Mental Health Struggle
> "I find myself increasingly struggling with my mental health - feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness and generally mental fog that is preventing me from bringing a lot of the energy that I would usually bring to the things that I do."

## Meta-Commentary on the Episode

### Experimental Format
> "In the spirit of everything I've just said, I don't know how this particular experiment in free-form monologuing went. I'm going to set it aside for a little bit and come back and listen to it. I've no doubt it'll need a bit of editing, or maybe I'll decide to throw it away. In the spirit of experimentation, maybe I'll share it, maybe I won't."

### Embodying the Message
> "But if you're listening to this, I did share it, which means I thought it was of some degree of quality. But maybe you disagree. Feel free to get in touch and let me know."
