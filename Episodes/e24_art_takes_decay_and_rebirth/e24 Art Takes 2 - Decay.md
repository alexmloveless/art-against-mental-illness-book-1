	*   The podcast, "Art Against Mental Illness," explores the healing power of art.
*   The host is releasing more "Art Takes" episodes, which involve him experimenting with artwork.
*   The current episode focuses on the theme of decay in art, inspired by the autumn season.
*   The artist describes his experimental and somewhat clumsy approach to creating abstract art using acrylic paints.
*   He discusses how acrylic paint can bubble and pucker when re-wetted, creating interesting textures.
*   The artist describes the process of layering paint, wetting it with diluted ink, and observing the organic patterns that emerge.
*   He uses paper cuttings to create ridges on the canvas, adding structure and texture.
*   The artist finds beauty in the decay of industrial surfaces and aims to capture that in his art.
*   He is fascinated by fractal patterns that emerge when mixing acrylic medium and ink.
*   The artist laments that the most beautiful, fleeting moments of the creative process are often lost when the paint dries.
*   He expresses a desire to capture these moments on video using a macro lens.
*   The artist finds the processes of nature, such as plants sprouting and trees changing, to be mesmerizing and inspiring.
*   He encourages listeners to look up and observe the beauty around them, whether in nature or architecture.
*   The artist describes the artwork after it has dried, noting the textures and colors that have emerged.
*   He is tempted to cut the artwork into smaller pieces but also wants to resist the urge to overwork it.
*   The artist discusses the next steps, including sealing the paint, varnishing the canvas, and framing the artwork.
*   He acknowledges the challenges of balancing his artistic vision with practical considerations like cost.
*   The artist expresses satisfaction with the artwork, viewing it as a collaboration between himself and nature.
*   He is pleased with the dramatic and colorful result and hopes that listeners will find something to appreciate in it.


Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this
is my podcast about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious
and anyone with an interest in mental health and well-being.
So this is another Art Takes episode. After the last one that I released someone commented to me
that they found the experience of listening to me noodle around with bits of artwork to be
quite relaxing. So that's that's a result I'm quite happy with. So I'm going to release some
more of these over the coming weeks. As ever this was recorded on my headphone mic so
the quality is not great. There's a version of this on YouTube. I'll put the link in the show notes
that has some visuals with it. The second part was actually videoed and I put some nice pictures
on the the video version where you'll get to see the actual picture that I was working on and some
other bits and pieces. I think it's all very karmic and calm so I hope you enjoy it and I
hope it makes you feel mellow and I'll be back again soon. Bye. Back in my studio it's the end
of November and for moment time my studio reads two degrees celsius what's that 30 39 or something
Fahrenheit. Thinking about decay something that is quite prevalent this time of the year with
autumn and the leaves falling and ferns and foliage dying back. It's not a negative thing.
Decay happens. Things grow and things die. Everything has it as its moment and I quite
like it. Much of the work I'm working on at the moment to the artwork is is is abstract
and one way or the other is sort of related to decay. It's just another natural process and
nature is quite good at finding ways to hide beauty in plain sight around processes that
aren't themselves necessarily the most desirable processes. No one likes to see the end of
something but if that end is is as beautiful as the golden or red leaves that adorn the countryside
certainly in the UK at the moment then it's a it's a good trade-off. Well because of the
slightly random way that I approach making art and I tend to be quite experimental but also
a little bit lazy and I'm very what's the word clumsy and so I tend to mess things up
because I just can't stop tinkering or doing stuff and I go too far cover everything in water
and paint and all these sorts of things and what happens is that things get messed up.
I use acrylic paints almost exclusively and they're supposed to be they're plastic really.
They're supposed to be waterproof and but and they are to a degree but it really depends on
the surface you put it on the particular medium you know the whether it's an expensive paint or
a cheap one you know all sorts of factors of play whether it's gloss or matte and the pigment used
and so if you if you paint some acrylic onto a surface and let it dry then wet it again
sometimes it will bubble up you've probably seen something similar if you've ever got your paints
on your walls wet and and if you've done that in your house someone splashed paint somewhere
splashed water or something on a some painting that started to bubble up or maybe you've seen
on a around a leak in your ceiling it's not desirable at all there and I understand that
but it's actually quite a beautiful effect and and where the paint lifts off the surface when
it's wet and and it and it bunches and puckers up and I'm looking at the canvas at the moment
where I've put several layers of paint on top of what was an old a very old painting that I'd never
finished and I never really liked and let it mostly dry and then I've wet it again and dripped
I wet it with various colors of heavily diluted acrylic ink and we've got all these little
amazing patterns coming up and some of it looks quite organic almost like the the ridging and
puckering you get around scars on your on your skin like little tiny mountain ranges and
the paint and the water pulls in between them and the shadows that they cast
give it a really interesting texture and of course the trick here is this is well
I say this is going to dry I've got the heater on and I've applied the hair dryer to this a bit
but it's so cold in here that it's going to take a long time to dry that irks me but
I think because it takes longer to dry we get more of this effect so I just need to be sort of
patient and when when this dries up this is part of the wonder of this type of process
is that I never really know how it's going to look and and obviously this is making the paint
and the medium more fragile if I touch it now I can just you know wipe the paint off and destroy
this in fact if I wanted to I could scrape a lot of this back and go back to the canvas but I
don't want to I want to keep as much as effect as I can so you know I have to let it dry and hope
that this texturing remains on the canvas and then it's still because it's lifted off the canvas
it's still going to be fragile so if there's some of this texturing left at the end when it's dry
I'll try and delicately seal it so that it's a little bit more sturdy and a bit more permanent
and I just really look forward to it I think you know I might get a bit antsy that things take
too long to dry middle of summer the the opposite is true things dry too quickly so I'm not very
easy to please but this process when it takes longer you're sort of stretching the time frame
out when you get to as you get to enjoy the the various stages and I need to remind myself
that you know art for me is all about the process and part of that process is just watching things
happen whether it's a you know a portrait emerging you know in front of me as I paint it or whether
I've created these organic effects letting inks or water or whatever flow across a surface
and what they're going to do and trying not to interfere with them it's so intensely mindful
and this particular canvas I put some texture on it already I've got I don't throw anything away
I've got a whole bag of cuttings of like A4 printer paper sheets that I've used for creating
collage or as references from my printer and so I've got loads of strips of edging off cut
of varying different weights of paper and I've just taken a bunch of these and I just used PVA
to stick them to the canvas so they've created these ridges that where it's just very slightly
stands proud of the the canvas and and then painted over that and the paints are dried around
it and stuck it to the canvas and then the the inks and stuff I've used sort of pulled down the
edges so it sort of created some structure in there and so what I'm looking at at the moment
almost looks like a like a you know a board of a I don't know a wall or a cupboard or something
that's been left outside to to get to decay but I've done it under sort of very controlled
circumstances something but there's something quite industrial about it
and I like photographing sort of decayed industrial rusty and flaky surfaces when I'm
out and about in a city or or in the town or or even in the country and you see it everywhere
and I think people don't notice it but I do and I find a real a real power and beauty in that and
I don't I don't really think about it in terms of do I like that it's decaying is it the fact that
it's decaying that I like or is it the fact that it's just beautiful and I think it's the latter I
think it's it's it's really interesting and beautiful and organic and you can walk out and
every door and see sort of organic structures and forms and shapes and growths and stuff
anywhere you like with its trees and fields or or whatever just plants in your garden or by the
side of the road and I think firstly you still get used to seeing that it starts to feel a little bit
monochrome and and and I think you should spend some time looking more closely at this stuff
because because it's all got its beauty but this this type of sort of industrial or modernistic
decay of things like paints and rust and and so on it's got its own beauty and its own organic
fractal nature what what I've really really noticed in the last couple of months when I've
pretty much been exclusively experimenting with abstract works of a sort of of either
fully sort of organic or sort of industrial organic nature you do things like I I created a
sort of a mixture of PVA and acrylic medium and and I I just purely by accident when they dropped
some ink acrylic ink into it and and it started creating all these beautiful little fractal
patterns like little trees with lots of little branches and and that will join and spread and
spread and they keep spreading and I just wash it so I get so mesmerized by them and they create so
many lots of little distinct unique patterns that won't be seen anywhere else ever again
like proper chaotic fractal patterns like a a snowflake and I can go on for hours about
chaos theory fractals and non-linear dynamics and all these things that relate to
types of order emerging from highly unordered high high entropy systems and maybe I'll one day
I'll do a an episode on chaos and introduce some of these concepts I don't want to scare too many
people away because it gets quite heavy duty quite quickly but I think if you're an artist
you've seen these types of things I think especially sort of watercolor artists where
you're doing wet on wet wet on dry and the different effects you get are hard to control
and highly organic and produce absolutely incredible patterns and shapes and textures and
and you'll you'll have observed the the swirls and the fractals and stuff in it and
and I hope you delight in that and you should sort of sit there and watch it rather than hoping
it will dry because that's really the best part and what's incredible about this is no one else
gets to see it so once my little fractal patterns dry then they're really hard to see and they
they sort of lose a bit of their distinction and their definition and they're still amazing but
they're not the thing that I saw when I was making it and I've tried various approaches to
trying to lock these in but all of them either end in roughly the same outcome or sort of ruin
ruin the color and the shapes and the organic nature of it so it doesn't really work and
and it's a real shame and I sort of I've genuinely been considering setting up my camera
you know I really need like a good macro lens something that can get real close up
and just making some videos of these things emerging because I'm like well look you can
see this work of art now right when it's finished and I think you'll like it
but but you miss the best part you know you miss the most exciting fun bit and the drama that
unfolded and only I got to see that and and I sort of feel like I'm denying the world something here
because it's one of the most engrossing things you can watch and if you're the sort of person
who likes watching clouds mutate or you can get mesmerized by a leaf floating around in a stream
or you know anyone who likes observing processes I get absolutely mesmerized by things like
factory conveyor belts and and anything that's sort of repetitive and but is doing something
that feels like it's achieving something and you know I just I can just get lost by just watching
things like that and so any sort of process for me I find wonderful and of course this process is
everywhere and and you you know some are slower and some are faster and in the beginning of
spring is such a magical time for me it's like Disneyland gets invited into my world once a year
for free as you watch the natural world rise up and recreate itself and create new things that are
the same but different and you know going to my garden and watching what's coming out whether
the shoots are shooting up and things are sprouting and just the excitement of all and
everything is so everything is so vibrant and new and fresh and you see these processes sort
of unfolding and it's actually you know in one sense it's quite slow and you're sort of willing
that bulb to sprout into a daff or daffodil or whatever but on the other hand you know you don't
want it to stop and and and sometimes it feels like it happens really quick and and so maybe you
have to go away for a bit to a city where you don't see much of it and you come back a few days
or a week later and and everything sort of exploded that the trees that didn't have leaves on them
a week ago suddenly a big wash of pale greens and yellows and and blocking out the sun and
soaking up all the all its energy and it's just so it's just so dramatic and and I think people
miss it I think I'm not going to berate people for looking down at their phones all the time I
I'm every bit as guilty as that of that as other people but I uh I really think that you've got to
turn it off every now and again and and lift your head up and look around and and maybe not as
not everyone's as mesmerized by the processes of nature for me maybe it's uh maybe it's
architecture I mean just walking around the town and the city people forget to look up
and over that row of shops there's there's always some really interesting buildings especially if
your town's been around for a while and and if you go down the the octoride the
high street octoride is just one big long road it's called the lang toon the long town and uh
there's such a mismatch of architecture and you see a lot of this sort of
mixture of newer stuff older stuff ugly 70s brutalism and uh really really ancient like
uh you know victorian era and older uh there's even a fragment of a castle uh in one place and
and some stunning old uh manor house buildings and lots and lots of decay lots of broken down
farming buildings and and the like and and they just look around you and there's so much to see
and it's just a little town that no one's heard of um you know 5 000 people live here but it's
just so much to see if you just lift your head up and take a look around and if that don't float
your boat we've got the mountains you know on the horizon sort of in both directions you can look
from here directly into the highlands and uh the grampians and there's so much to see and
what i love about this place is that it's never the same two minutes in the row the scottish
weather is the best variable and but there's so much dramatic scenery to see there's so much
character in every direction that you look and and you never get bored with the views because
you never see the same view twice and because the views are so big because the vistas are so
grand it there's always some drama to see somewhere and and why do you need you know
the latest uh kardashian or football wife spat on your on your phone when you when you've got that
again i'm not begrudging people that stuff i just think you need to make time and space for
other things um the the glorious world around you because there's a whole bunch of people hell bent
in on destroying it and maybe maybe these processes won't be visible for too much longer
and if they're not and i've got my i've got my paints and i've got my decay and my bubbling
bubbling bubbling surfaces and and little mountain ranges and splashes and washes of color
and fractal explosions just magnificent contrasts and textures i it's really hard not to not to touch
it because i i like to especially when i've got a lot of texture in a picture i like to touch it
because it just feels nice it feels interesting and i'll destroy this if i touch it i have to wait
until it dries i did once consider making one or more artworks that are highly textures and built
to be touched so that you could put them up in a gallery and and people would be encouraged to
touch it and it would sort of wear away over time and and you could sort of keep turning it around
so that different bits of it get touched move it to different places move it at different heights
and just keep moving so it's this living artwork that that changes over over years and years very
slightly very slowly as people wear away bits of it it's the next day now and i'm back in my studio
uh my studio is a total mess but uh i've come back to to see my uh the artwork that i was
playing around with yesterday um so let's see how we've got on i took it into the house last night
uh because i wanted to let it dry a bit a lot it was on my one of my radiators and
and uh it's dried i think completely so i can now touch it and there's nothing coming off
and i'm looking at where all of the the sort of bubbling and uh and the ridges and
where the the paint was made wet um and it's all completely dried now and it's kept a lot of its
texture actually uh way more than i thought uh when i first looked at it this morning
it wasn't in very good light and i thought it had sort of flattened out and sort of disappeared and
it has definitely flattened out but uh it's still very much there and it's if anything there's some
new features come out of it there's a real sort of mixing of colors coming on here and where the
pain to the inks have have pulled in between ridges and so on there are definitely features
of this it feels like a like almost like an alien landscape because i'd actually put some
pretty big blobs of oh what was it oh i i found some old blobs of paint stuck to a
an easel and i pulled those off and stuck them on to give it a bit of texture and they're
almost like mountains and you can imagine we're looking down at the surface of an alien planet
and and go around and over it and there's there's lots of different terrain
and the colors are really vibrant and in this light and there's definitely different regions
of this uh and there's little little bits that are really really interesting and i'm always sort
of tempted with stuff like this to to cut it up into little pieces because there's a hole that
i think it's cool i think i need to have a little bit more of a tinker with it but it's
it feels quite balanced which is which is really my litmus test but there's so many little regions
on here that could be broken up into smaller artworks or make a little grid of them and
i think that would be cool but what i also think would be cool is just not doing that and leaving
the hell alone i need to resist the urge to tinker here i feel like doing is it's just
working on a few bits to bring out some of the features and maybe i will but i've got a nasty
tendency to mess things up and and i don't really don't want to do that maybe this is done and and
there's nothing more to do but but this is just the beginning of the next phase because some of
these bits of paint i think are quite fragile uh so i have to seal them a bit and i then have to
decide how i want to uh varnish it or whether i want to vanish i think it has to be varnish given
the amount of abuse that i've given this canvas to protect it and so i have to wait for it to dry
before i can do that and then what type of cam what type of varnish do i want and you know
sometimes it seems obvious that you'll use say a gloss varnish because because it sort of it
tends to really bring out the color but um i did some gloss some stuff the other day in it
and it actually didn't work uh it just it wasn't the right approach for those particular paintings
where i've uh used graphite to create a sheen and uh the gloss varnish actually ended up
dulling it it had more of a sheen on it before i varnished it so i've got to be careful here
and then it it's buckled a bit overnight because i had it on the radiator it's only on canvas board
uh and and it's pretty crappy cheap old bit of canvas board so if someone wants to put this
on their wall it's not in a state to do that uh so it would need to be uh reinforced somehow and
uh and framed and again none of these are particularly arduous tasks but it's all
stuff that i've got to make decisions about and i don't have a lot of money so i can't really
afford to put a really nice frame on this uh and it's quite conceivable that i just have to
leave it how it is uh until i can afford to get it framed and that seems a bit of a shame because
i think this is i've been messing around with abstract for for weeks now and i'm now starting
to you know find my feet with this a bit and uh this is probably one of my favorites i've done
so far my love of vibrant colors has really come out in this one and i i'm almost tempted to try and
bring them out a little bit more but there's uh there's a danger that i'll end up unbalancing
it and making it um making it worse i've got it's such a such a difficult thing at this point to
to just stop and say no just leave it alone and sometimes i've had to get people to tell me to
just stop and leave it alone and i've had to do that to other people too but it's just
i most don't want to finish working on it because i've really enjoyed doing it and
where do i start with the next one i'm running out of canvases at a rate of knots and
you know when i put things away you know i tend to put them away and forgetting about them and
i never really look at them quite as much again um and i don't really know i don't i don't i'm not
a backwards looking person i don't i don't tend to do that but and so it's a bit of a shame because i
i think i often miss the pleasure of going back and i'm really looking at stuff that i've created
but in terms of creating something organic and and and something dramatic i guess i guess what
i wanted with this is dramatic and my favorite abstract works are all quite dramatic and and
full of color and texture and and just lots of interesting details and that's absolutely what
i've achieved with this maybe you like it maybe you won't maybe abstract is not your thing but
if you don't if you're looking at this and you don't see something in it that you find beguiling
and or even disturbing or or uncomfortable i think there's something in here and
that you know anyone can at least appreciate and and i'd like to you know i'd say i take credit
for this and you know i'm blowing my own trumpet and saying well this is a good work of art maybe
it isn't maybe it's just good for me but um i sort of didn't make it uh nature made this
and and the environment made it and i uh i feel like it was a sort of a teamwork it was a
it was a partnership and that's what i've really really enjoyed and um and so i don't mind
standing here going look at look at this cool thing that i made because
you know like anything i've made it's it's only partly me um and now as i show it to the world it's
one way or the other partly you as you expunge your brain of all memory of it
but uh it's almost it's like a bit of a celebration for me uh i'm really really quite pleased
with how this has come out and i'll try not to tinker and i will tell you if i do and you can be
certainly angry at me unless i actually improve it uh all my sensible instincts are telling me
to leave it the hell alone um and that's maybe what i'll do i guess watch this space to find out
