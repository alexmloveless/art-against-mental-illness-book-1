# Episode 24: Art Takes - Decay and Rebirth - Significant Quotes

## Core Philosophy on Decay

> "Decay happens. Things grow and things die. Everything has its moment and I quite like it."

> "It's not a negative thing. Decay happens... nature is quite good at finding ways to hide beauty in plain sight around processes that aren't themselves necessarily the most desirable processes."

> "No one likes to see the end of something but if that end is as beautiful as the golden or red leaves that adorn the countryside certainly in the UK at the moment then it's a good trade-off."

## Self-Description as Artist

> "I tend to be quite experimental but also a little bit lazy and I'm very what's the word clumsy and so I tend to mess things up because I just can't stop tinkering or doing stuff and I go too far cover everything in water and paint and all these sorts of things and what happens is that things get messed up."

## Technical Process Descriptions

> "if you paint some acrylic onto a surface and let it dry then wet it again sometimes it will bubble up... it's actually quite a beautiful effect and where the paint lifts off the surface when it's wet and it bunches and puckers up"

> "some of it looks quite organic almost like the ridging and puckering you get around scars on your skin like little tiny mountain ranges and the paint and the water pulls in between them and the shadows that they cast give it a really interesting texture"

## Process vs. Product Philosophy

> "art for me is all about the process and part of that process is just watching things happen whether it's a portrait emerging in front of me as I paint it or whether I've created these organic effects letting inks or water or whatever flow across a surface"

> "it's so intensely mindful"

## Fractal Pattern Discovery

> "I created a sort of a mixture of PVA and acrylic medium and I just purely by accident when they dropped some ink acrylic ink into it and it started creating all these beautiful little fractal patterns like little trees with lots of little branches"

> "they create so many lots of little distinct unique patterns that won't be seen anywhere else ever again like proper chaotic fractal patterns like a snowflake"

## The Ephemeral Nature of Beauty

> "what's incredible about this is no one else gets to see it so once my little fractal patterns dry then they're really hard to see and they sort of lose a bit of their distinction and their definition"

> "you can see this work of art now right when it's finished and I think you'll like it but you miss the best part you know you miss the most exciting fun bit and the drama that unfolded and only I got to see that"

> "I sort of feel like I'm denying the world something here because it's one of the most engrossing things you can watch"

## Observation and Mindfulness

> "you should sort of sit there and watch it rather than hoping it will dry because that's really the best part"

> "I get absolutely mesmerized by things like factory conveyor belts and anything that's sort of repetitive and but is doing something that feels like it's achieving something"

## Nature and Seasonal Process

> "in the beginning of spring is such a magical time for me it's like Disneyland gets invited into my world once a year for free as you watch the natural world rise up and recreate itself"

> "going to my garden and watching what's coming out whether the shoots are shooting up and things are sprouting and just the excitement of all and everything is so everything is so vibrant and new and fresh"

## Call to Awareness

> "I really think that you've got to turn it off every now and again and lift your head up and look around"

> "people forget to look up and over that row of shops there's there's always some really interesting buildings especially if your town's been around for a while"

> "there's so much to see if you just lift your head up and take a look around"

## Scottish Setting

> "what I love about this place is that it's never the same two minutes in the row the Scottish weather is the best variable"

> "you never get bored with the views because you never see the same view twice and because the views are so big because the vistas are so grand it there's always some drama to see somewhere"

## Industrial vs. Natural Beauty

> "I like photographing sort of decayed industrial rusty and flaky surfaces when I'm out and about in a city or in the town or even in the country and you see it everywhere and I think people don't notice it but I do and I find a real power and beauty in that"

> "this type of sort of industrial or modernistic decay of things like paints and rust and so on it's got its own beauty and its own organic fractal nature"

## Artistic Decision Making

> "I'm always sort of tempted with stuff like this to cut it up into little pieces... but what I also think would be cool is just not doing that and leaving the hell alone I need to resist the urge to tinker here"

> "sometimes I've had to get people to tell me to just stop and leave it alone and I've had to do that to other people too"

## Partnership with Nature

> "I sort of didn't make it nature made this and the environment made it and I feel like it was a sort of a teamwork it was a partnership"

> "I don't mind standing here going look at this cool thing that I made because you know like anything I've made it's only partly me"

## Final Reflection

> "it's almost it's like a bit of a celebration for me I'm really really quite pleased with how this has come out and I'll try not to tinker"

> "all my sensible instincts are telling me to leave it the hell alone and that's maybe what I'll do"
