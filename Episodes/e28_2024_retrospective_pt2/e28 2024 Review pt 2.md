Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. Hello and welcome back and a Happy New Year.
I hope you had a good holiday stroke Christmas stroke New Year period. I recognise that this
period is quite hard for many people especially my neurodivergent friends and hope the last couple
of weeks gave you peace and a bit of respite from the onslaught of the holiday period.
And I hope that getting back into normal life isn't too jarring for everybody. This year is
looking like it's going to be anything but boring for all of us so be safe and be nice to each other.
This is part two of my 2024 first six months 496 minutes 8.3 hours and 25 episodes retrospective
of Art Against Mental Illness. This is coming a bit later than I intended partly because I discovered
that no one really listens to podcasts over Christmas so there wasn't really much point in
publishing anything and partly because I was enjoying myself too much in the studio and thus
was sort of avoiding this. It's currently minus temperatures outside and my studio is almost
unbearably cold and I have to wrap up like an Arctic explorer to spend any time out there so
I'm in the cosy confines of my office recording this for you people. So without any further ado
I'm just going to get back into my per episode recap. And this starts with episode 10 released
July 21st 2024 called Suffering for Art. This was quite a dark one. I can't really remember
exactly what triggered my decision to do an episode on this. I was listening to a series of podcasts
that there was a retrospective on the early 90s Seattle music scene, the whole grunge scene and
I think anyone who's even vaguely aware of that period will know we lost quite a few incredible
artists such as Kurt Cobain, Lane Staley, Mark Lanigan and latterly Chris Cornell to various
self-inflicted tragedies and I think that led me to sort of reflect on the nature of art as a
conversation with an artist and their fans and and these people died because they were suffering
in their lives because of their fame because of their lifestyles because of very many complex
reasons that led to extremely poor mental health and that they used their art as an outlet and I
think that there's a sort of dangerous perspective that an artist must suffer to make good art which
I think is incredibly wrong. All artists use art as a way to relieve suffering and they suffered
despite their art not because of it and I think this is a really important point to remember.
I think it's contingent to us as art fans to support the people that we revere rather than
to constantly pressure and badger them. There's been a particular problem over the past year
with various artists in the spotlight. The one that springs to mind is Chappell Rohn who are
really suffering because of what's called the toxic fanhood where your very own fans are hounding you
to the ends of the earth and and watching everything that you do and it can become quite
unpleasant and I think Kurt Cobain particularly had an issue with this. I think we need to give our
our heroes a bit of space and a bit of a break and don't expect them to constantly feed our
Nifa catharsis with their misery. If you love someone just let them be who they need to be and
give them space. I do remember I actually wrote this episode while I was on a train going to and
from a coastal town in Scotland where me and my family went and we found a beach and I went swimming
in the sea in Scotland which I'm sure you'll agree is quite brave of me and I encountered a
seal who was just bobbing around in the water watching me and there were dolphins cavorting
about a mile away and it was absolutely incredible experience so I had a bit of a
jarring juxtaposition in here as I was experiencing something quite life-affirming
and while considering a bunch of people who had who had lost theirs through mental illness so it
was all quite poignant to me so this episode is quite a personal episode and something that I
really really feel very strongly about. Cobain, Cornell, Plath, Van Gogh, White House and countless
others none of them owed me you or anyone else their pain and certainly not their lives. For
you and I to experience their pain for it to feel authentic these artists must have experienced that
pain but let us be specific here depression can be fatal it kills via suicide. Shunning or
criticizing an artist for seeming more cheerful or positive or dare I say it happy is in a sense
equivalent to expecting a cancer sufferer to dial back their treatment so that you can continue to
empathize in their struggle. We don't need artists to suffer to gratify our need for catharsis
suffering happens that's a fact of life but it is never necessary never never it is always wrong
to wish or otherwise expect someone else to experience pain for our own gratification.
These people were not martyrs to their art or their fans they were humans experiencing
intolerable levels of illness and misery they used art, creativity, performance as a release
and a relief and we should be thankful and feel blessed that they did but they didn't suffer
because of their art they suffered despite their art. Onto the next one this was July 31st
2024 called Therapeutic Outlet Transitions so this was another one of my therapeutic outlet
sessions where I basically just get in front of a microphone and ramble about something.
This was happening while I was in the process of moving house which I really really didn't want to
do moving to a new studio. Uprooting my life and and moving to a situation I was not at all happy
with but had come about via necessity it turned out that that move probably wasn't so wise after
all and so I took the hit on this while not actually removing the problem that it was supposed
to remove so it's all been a bit complicated and unpleasant. So I ramble on here about how
transitions for most of us are inherently traumatic. I think a lot of people when going
through some sort of transitional difficult period will drop their creative endeavors as something
that is perhaps a luxury of time and space and effort that can't be afforded because you need
all your mental energy and time to deal with whatever you're dealing with the transition
that you're experiencing and I argue that this is the wrong way to think about this and if you
rely on art as a therapeutic outlet like I do then you need to make room in whatever way you can
to spend time doing your creative practices despite the fact that you might find that
difficult to do because this is such an important part of who you are and how you maintain your
mental health and I think the time you need it most is when life is its most challenging. So don't
consider this time that you spend doing this as a luxury I think you should consider it as essential
and I recognize it's not always possible to do this but wherever it is don't drop your creative
activities because you think they're a luxury keep them going because they're definitely not.
If like me you're going through a transition you have my sympathy and if like me you're the type
of person that finds these things very very difficult you need to make sure that you look
after yourself you need to make sure that you have your space to escape and to re-center it there is
never a more important time to find those spaces than in times like this.
Thursday August 8th 2024 How to Be Creative Part 1 All That Jazz. Now I promise to continue this
series at some point I got to part two which we'll cover in a little bit but I put quite a lot of
effort into these. I feel like I want to do this subject justice and therefore I do quite a lot of
research and I try and bring quite a lot of subject areas and inspiration and so they take
me a long time to write and trying to write episode two of this series was for me very very
difficult and saw very many false starts but the first episode sort of came tumbling out of me
off the back of a bit of a deep dive into this and I really enjoyed writing it and I talk about
the rudiments of creativity and introduce the concept that I come back to over and over again
which is the need to introduce a bit of chaos into your artistic practice. I talk about John Coltrane
a lot and his approach to creativity and various other artists as well and I think this is a really
good episode I'm really pleased with that. So with my original list mastery, conviction and open
mind, collaboration and focus you have a set of ingredients that can be put together in varying
measures to cook up something different but to really mix things up you need a sprinkling of chaos.
It's like making your omelette with all the usual stuff then picking up something random from the
fridge or pantry to add in every time you make it to see what works. Sure some omelettes will end
up being choked down or just thrown in the bin but once in a while you'll create something magical.
So chaos isn't one of the core ingredients it's more like a method or seasoning it can be applied
to any or all of the ingredients at any point in the process in any amount. It could be argued that
as far as creativity is concerned it is the magic unicorn juice. Episode 13 fighting back
Sunday September the 8th there was a a month between these two episodes and that was not
my intention. This is probably where my challenges of 2024 hit their nadir or their apex depending
on which way you want to look at it and I simply was not functioning on any meaningful level
and I felt like I needed to do my how to be creative part two and I couldn't get it out
and I couldn't really find any mental energy to do the things that I needed to do to get another
episode out. I didn't think anyone cared I was listening I thought it was all pointless.
I really had a crisis of everything. I'd spent a bunch of time preparing for a solo exhibition
that went well but not many people turned up and I've been using the preparation and the energy
and the momentum for that to prop up my sort of self-esteem and that all came crashing down when
when the exhibition was over and I found myself in a very dark place indeed and it took me a few
weeks to recalibrate and figure out what was going on and what I needed to do to make myself better
and that's when this episode came out. I chose to record a very frank episode about what had
been happening to me and how I was at that point and how how my mental health was at that point
and to make a resolution a commitment to to get better and to dig myself out of this hole and
I remember at this point I was still very very low and where I am now versus that is is quite
stark I mean in a much better mental space but what's important to note is that my life
situation the problems that I had back then have not gone away and it's arguable they've got worse
um but I feel way more optimistic way more energetic way more enthusiastic and way more
creative I'm being ridiculously creative at the moment and and that gives me hope that I can find
solutions to my problems and to really um as as this episode says fight back to to really recover
and to um make something of the next year and the coming years despite all the horrors that
are going on in the world and my my resolution is to help people is to do something for the
community and do something for other people to help anyone who has struggled like I have to
lead a better life to conquer their mental illness and to find solace beauty and comfort and
creativity and and I hope I'm achieving that in some small way but I'm not done by a very long
shot and I'm going to make this bigger and better over the coming year and and I hope you'll join
me for it I think I'll look back on this episode from time to time in the future and and use it to
remind myself of of how bad things can get and how recovery is possible and as as much as this
podcast is is to a degree um a sort of a diary or a memoir of my life and the things that I'm
thinking uh this is going to be one of the most important chapters
so this is my fight back I choose to recognize distress itself as my enemy and to face it down
to do this I need to accept the fact while recognizing my situation on its face values
it is what it is nothing more nothing less then I need to do the things I need to do to show my
brain what I expect of it I will keep taking on reality one day at a time I will keep fighting
I will get better and I acknowledge that there will be peaks and troughs but I choose to keep
fighting so episode 14 uh October the 15th 2024 I was still putting things out pretty slow
that was what three weeks later something like that this one's called overthinking
and I think this was me finally breaking my right as block in terms of creating content for this
podcast and I think probably in general as well one of the the things that comes with depression
and anxiety is a tendency to overthink everything and to uh overanalyze and to find reasons to not
do things to find reasons to be pessimistic and it's not it's not a choice as such it's just
something that our brains are doing because of the the poor state that they're in and and so I wrote
an episode on overthinking to try and get me out of overthinking and I think it's a really really
important part of the artistic process and to manifest itself in all sorts of ways for example
right as block or not being able to uh continue a podcast and this really was the point where I
started again almost I almost start to think of it as season two of this podcast although it's not
how I divide things up that's ultimately what it became and uh and it's a good episode and it feels
really fresh for me and it does feel like a bit like a new start and and again I think I'll look
back on this one there's quite a positive thing let me be explicit about this overthinking is
a poison to spontaneity and art regardless how you approach it is underpinned by spontaneity
the strokes or the marks you put down on a canvas or paper the notes you lay down on a piano
there's always a level of spontaneity that happens to create the thing in front of you
you are not a machine you're a sentient being and therefore the job of creation is a process
and it's necessarily spontaneous episode 15 uh october 24th 2024 finding your voice
what's interesting to me is how little I understand my own artistic voice
for me it feels like I'm I'm very haphazard stylistically speaking and that I'm always trying
different things I'm always throwing everything I can at whatever I'm doing and and anything that
comes to my mind or anything that's available around me sort of just gets stuffed in it's a bit
of a kitchen sink approach and sometimes I look across my recent body of work and think you know
you could take chunks out of this and think this is not the same person that made this when it is
and I and I think that's wrong and I've been told many times by people that know you can't see the
thread that runs through this but we all can and and that people see that it ties together and they
see that it expresses who I am as a person and I think I'm having to become more confident about
this idea that well yes I'm always going to have a very varied stylistic base and and as I'm doing
at the moment I think the job is to pull them all together into a sort of single statement
that can define my body of work and my approach to art and and I'm becoming more confident about
that even if I don't really still know what my voice is but your voice evolves as I say in this
episode over time anyway and and don't be afraid of that and I don't think I'll ever be satisfied
and stay in one place and I don't really want to be and so finding my voice is about coaxing that
thread out of my body of work and and sort of finding that path that runs through it and
celebrating and exposing that and and that that's my voice and at some point I'm going to be able to
express what that is I hope. Finding a voice is as much about blocking other people's voices,
it's as much about not listening to critics, of not judging yourself by yardsticks of culture or
society and to trust your own instincts and to trust that your work will connect with people
and if you can do that all the while keeping your sanity then you'll be a force to be reckoned with
but one way or another your voice will only come when you stop shutting it down and just let it
flow. Episode 16 was a a bit of a frivolous addendum to episode 15 this was on released
on the same day I literally walked out of the house after having recorded this and was
wandering around in the woods and found myself sort of thinking about this process and and sort
of walking around and thinking about how I create this this podcast and thinking how that relates
to sort of me finding my voice and and why it is the way it is and I ramble on a bit about AI.
I don't really know what my overall point here was but it felt like I was saying something decent
and I was recording it because I wanted to write it up as a script and do it as another episode
as a sort of finding of a voice part too and when I listened back to it I was like well I've actually
said what I wanted to say here quite well and the sound quality was possibly decent so I just
shared it and it's all all very meta because you get a sense from this about how I conceive of
these episodes and how I sort of write them and create my notes and my material to sort of rewrite
and this is also me finding a bit more confidence in my ability to just talk and to say good things
so I quite like that one. Maybe I could get a model to talk in my voice but would it make the
choices that I made? Would it if I said to it insert some examples in here would it would
chose the examples that I chose because they're very much part of me my brain the things that I
know the knowledge that I have. On first date October the 31st I released How to Be Creative
part two Moar My Problems. This is second part of the How to Be Creative series and it covers
one of the most important aspects with regards to my philosophy of the creation of art which is
art is fundamentally the business of solving problems and that if you're not solving problems
you're probably not being very creative and to be creative you have to push yourself and you have
to push your limits problems that you encounter the problem of how to take this thing you see in
front of you or this idea that you have or this emotion that you feel and translate that into
something on a canvas or on a film or on a video or as a sculpture or whatever it is you're doing
how do you do that how do you solve the problem of instantiating that making ideas tangible and
solid in the real world and I think that's one of the the main components of what creativity is.
Perhaps the most important job for an artist is connecting with other humans via their medium.
Art is communication a conversation with other humans via the shared understanding of culture.
If you expose your voice in the lazy artificial way people will hear that lack of care and passion
and turn their backs. You can't connect with the world if you don't have something compelling or
at least vaguely interesting to say and then affecting and engaging means to do that and you
can't create something compelling and engaging before having figured out the problem of having
to do so and doing so is where the good stuff is. It's the part that involves meaningful work,
it's the part that involves challenge and growth, it's the part where you find mindfulness and flow,
it's the part that involves the sense of fulfillment and achievement.
Episode 18 Art Against Mental Politics Art, Protest and Catharsis November the 7th 2024.
This one was conceived of and written just as the American election was happening. So I wrote
the first draft expecting to record it just before the election, didn't get round to it and then
had to sort of redraft it a bit after I discovered that Trump had won the election. Obviously I
wasn't particularly happy about this advent as many people aren't apart from Vladimir Putin and
Elon Musk and sort of thinking about the function of art as a political vehicle, a vehicle of protest
or catharsis or a driver for political change and whether or not you believe you can affect
the world from a political perspective of art is one thing but the idea that art and politics aren't
intrinsically linked is nonsensical and just making art is an act of protest in itself,
is an act of rebellion. Political systems and societies resist change and innovation and
as we're discovering more and more particularly in the US that the ability to speak freely and
create freely is a gift and it's one that should be sacrosanct as a core part of human rights and
it's increasingly becoming difficult or even dangerous to do that as despotic or fascist
movements spring up all over the world and the first thing these movements are going to do or
their leaders are going to do is to carve self-expression which includes creativity and at
any point simply painting a landscape or a still life is a political act at that point
because they don't want people thinking, they don't want people creating, they want people to be
docile and compliant and creative people tend not to be compliant so I don't really care who you are
if you're making art you're creating to some degree a piece of political culture and it's
worth remembering that especially when people tell you that you know why are you getting involved in
all this political stuff you know you should just make nice things and I would strongly advise you
to push back on that keep doing what you're doing keep fighting in a good fight
whether your art is explicitly political or purely aesthetic your freedom of expression to choose
what to represent and how is a reinforcement of liberty and a middle finger up to tyrants
to quote german poet and playwright Bertolt Brex art is not a mirror held up to society
but a hammer with which to shape it next time you find some space for creativity or when you find
yourself experiencing some great art which is basically constantly remember this in itself it
is an act of defiance defiance of the status quo and the defiance of all those who seek to perpetuate
the status quo for their own malignant ends artists change be the change episode 19 your
brain on art part one bad homeostasis uh Tuesday November the 12th 2024 this was part of what is
currently a two-part series part one I cover my theory of bad homeostasis which I talk a lot about
neurochemicals as relates to how we operate as humans and and how they dictate our mental health
and I might as well bring in episode 20 at the same time here which is your brain on art part two
Zen in the art of mental wellness maintenance Monday November the 18th 2024 these two were
basically a continuation the first one I sort of cover the basic principles of neuroscience and
episode two I finally get around to how that manifests in poor mental health with a view to
setting up an overall argument as to why creativity helps manage and improve mental health
what's interesting about this is that the first part of this is one of the most listened to episodes
I've ever done the second part of it is one of the least listened to episodes and I don't really
know what to take from that but it's certainly not a emphatic endorsement of this I think I
probably spent too much time talking about the science and not enough time talking about the art
but this is who I am I love science I love technology and I love art I love it all and
I love it when it comes together so I'll probably well I'll definitely do at least a part three on
this I can probably do about 12 parts on it but I don't think that will be very popular
but I'll at least try and finish off this series because it is important to me
and I know there are people out there that do care about this stuff so it will get finished
and and yeah screwed a lot yeah I'm gonna do it anyway only joking I love you all
mental illness is just like any other type of illness it has causes and treatments however
there's an odd and pervasive stigma around mental illness that seeks to make us believe it's all
imagined and therefore the sufferer can pull themselves together snap out of it or cheer up
but mental illness is never imagined and people can't just pull themselves together any more than
someone with dysentery can just get on with eating and give the toilet a break
episode 21 art takes abstract fluidity uh November the 21st a few days later so I've
I've published a few of these I'll explain what they are now because I'll probably gloss over the
the rest of them uh essentially you know I started dictating random crap while I was doing stuff
usually walking around the Scottish countryside but sometimes in my studio and I've also filmed
myself working and various other bits and pieces I thought I'd share this as an experiment to see
if you find it interesting to see if it gave you um a little bit of a window into my creative
practice and maybe help people think about that practice in a much more concrete way I've spent
a lot of time over the last few months uh dripping ink and an acrylic medium down canvases and bits
of wood as a an experiment on how I could create new sort of forms and textures and patterns
by just letting the substances I work with do their thing and then how can I form those into
works of art either abstract art or figurative art using sort of a background of of abstraction
and I've really really enjoyed doing that and it's really coming together now um it's worth
checking out my youtube channel for some videos on this stuff uh I'll be posting more I found this
period of experimentation a little bit daunting and jading as much as I enjoyed actually doing it
I sort of didn't really know where I was going with it so I've sort of taken a a detour to try
and expand my creative palette as it were and and now I'm trying to merge that back into my
overall body of work and it's working really well and I'm really really loving what I'm doing
and it's um it's also making me revisit a lot of old artworks and bring them back to life again
this is also in part because I've got no money and I can't really afford to buy new canvases and
things so I'm forced to go and look at what I've got and make use of that and it's been a really
creative period and I start this new year feeling unbelievably positive about my artistic output
even if I don't quite know what I'm going to do with it so anyway I'll probably still keep
publishing the odd art take as I record something that's worth listening to and doesn't require too
much of you understanding the visual side of what I'm doing and I hope you enjoy them for me they're
quite fun to make and so I'll definitely do more I think the other thing I've got going on here is
since I don't really know how to conceive of abstract paintings letting nature do its thing
gives me hints and points directions for me into how to progress and and try different things
right uh episode 22 uh November the 26th 2024 Egotista Impostor the misunderstood relationship
between art and identity now I really enjoyed making this one I did some research on Frida
Carlo for this which I really enjoyed and and she was such a brilliant and inspiring artist and human
I felt really pleased that I was able to talk about her in this context and I think that
she's one of the very exemplars of the concept of of identity through art and I think this is me
sort of figuring out something about my own art in that I I consider this podcast part of my artistic
body of work and you know and I consider increasingly my identity as an important
part of the work that I produce and and how that's perceived and I always sort of feel a little bit
like that that seems a little bit egotistical or narcissistic this was me sort of figuring out what
my view on that was and my view on it is that you're going to put yourself into your art anyway
you're you only produce what you produce because you are you and only you can do that and and
therefore as much as you might try and get out of the way of of your subject and the creative muse
you're there all over it anyway whether you like it or not so you might as well embrace that and
celebrate it you don't have to do what Frida Carlo did and paint lots of pictures of herself as a way
to to share her feelings on the world and her emotional states and her points of view but
there's no sense either in hiding yourself it's you this is about you once you sell your artwork
it's still to a degree about you even if other people project themselves onto it and that's part
of the beauty of art is it's the synthesis of you and someone else your brain and someone else's
brain your ideas and someone else's ideas so just let it all out in fact your humanity and your
presence in your history your life your reputation your influence the color of your skin your height
the tone of your voice these are all things that send signals to other humans about you and the
thing that you're conveying and it's inescapable you can try and change it but there's only so far
you can go with this your communications your interface with the world is your identity
some people choose to expose and mediate that via selfies and 30-second videos
some choose to paint a bowl of fruit that took them weeks to create some dance
some write erotic fan fiction about vampires episode 23 talking therapy art policing cancer
and recovery with Sharon Milton so this was the first interview episode I've done I've got two
published so far this one with my good friend Sharon who's been incredibly supportive of me
my podcast and my arts ever since I met her around a year ago I guess she's got such an amazing story
and a really inspiring story as well and and has had such a fascinating interesting life and it
was an absolute pleasure to interview her and I'm really privileged that she agreed to do this and
to be the first person to be interviewed by me because who knows how how that was going to go
but it went really really well and so I'm super pleased with this one and if you've not listened
to it I really recommend it above almost all other episodes it's so so fascinating and Sharon will no
doubt turn up again on this podcast at some point I was looking at the world through very different
lens when I was living with cancer in terms of you know every sunset was like looking at the last
sunset every daffodil was like the only daffodil in the whole world so it gave me a perspective
where I really saw beauty in absolutely everything which you know was quite poignant and for me
that period of my art was about capturing in absolute detail and with precision
episode 24 was another art take this was more of me dripping things down the canvas
and talking a bit about how we should embrace natural processes particularly things like decay
because they're quite beautiful in their own way this process when it takes longer you're sort of
stretching the time frame out when you get to as you get to enjoy the the various stages and
I need to remind myself that you know art for me is all about the process and part of that process
is just watching things happen whether it's a you know a portrait emerging you know in front of me
as I paint it or whether I've created these organic effects letting inks or water or whatever
flow across a surface and what they're going to do and trying not to interfere with them it's so
intensely mindful episode 25 Tuesday December the 10th 2024 Mind Your Language Alex Against Art
Speak now I loved making this one it really did go to the core of one of the reasons that I
found it difficult to break into art and to feel like I belonged here as part of the art community
because every time I read anything out about art I find it unbelievably condescending and self
important and basically unintelligible and for a while I thought this was a deficiency in in me
I'm I'm pretty sure I'm dyslexic and the ADHD doesn't help I find reading large blocks of text
incredibly unpleasant and difficult and slow and and that's pretty much defines the majority of of
art criticism and art commentary forever and I hate it it's horrible it's grotesque and and it's
really alienating and and for me art needs to be inclusive it should be something for everyone
it should be out there so that anyone can understand it it should be explained in plain language
so that people can engage with it I'm not saying there's no place for people
uh writing this pseudo intellectual drivel and I'm sure many people love it but I don't and I
want people out there to know that you don't have to either it's not prerequisite you don't have to
write this bollocks about your art you don't have to learn a whole new vocabulary just to describe
a still life that you painted and you don't have to read this crap and I also proved that chat
gpt can write it really well so it's not even that impressive and I'm really sorry if you're
the sort of person that writes this the people who write this stuff clearly have a great degree of
love for their for their art form it's just that I don't like it soz it's a book about Francis Bacon
by someone called Michael Lieris I just scanned through some of the texts and found this paragraph
um notice that this paragraph was not only in the most heinous of art speak but is also
basically one entire long sentence I'm going to attempt to read this sentence um and and see how
I get on with it I'm reading directly from the book here it's a good book and Francis Bacon is
a good artist let's see how well I uh I butcher this line behind the glass which according to him
is a means of unifying material unevenness in the painting by which I suspect or by which I
suspect is also intended to temper to some extent the realistic virulence of the works or perhaps
to give a certain ceremonial dignity to the presentation of the character's court it would
seem in more often than not in a warm tangle of erotic exchange or in the commonplace waking or
sleeping attitudes not to mention the grossly functional ones or again to extend to the whole
picture including the flat background and to finalize thanks to an almost literally englobing
that process of setting apart of removal from the neutrality of everyday life which is achieved
as regards to certain of its features by the most diverse means Bacon's canvases at once so
effervescent and so controlled provide for the spectator who looks at them as a whole and
grass them in their diversity as a striking image of this unique contemporary artist
in all his complexity a complexity I had hoped markedly to reduce by studying him
in the mirror of his work
oh my god that was one sentence please god help me
episode 26 was the first half of this retrospective and I'm sure you all found that
absolutely riveting as you were finding this one and finally episode 27 talking therapy art
science tech and burnout with Mark Burton I've known Mark for a long time I really really love
this conversation we take different approaches to art and science and technology we come from quite
different worlds but we're very very similar people and we really riff off each other when
we talk and for me this conversation only scratched the absolute surface of the overlap of what we
think and and how we approach the world and and we tend to get really excitable when we talk to
each other which isn't very often so I've resolved to do some more stuff with him in in the new year
whether or not that turns up on this podcast or whether or not just my youtube channel or
perhaps I'll start a new podcast or channel but you'll be hearing more from Mark hopefully
and I'm really really looking forward to that because I really love talking to him
the process of making something in whatever media is a kind of way of articulating a response and
a reaction to something in life and even the most abstract of artists will still
be responding to something it's a reaction art is a reaction to something
and that brings me to the end that's that's the most recent episode apart from this one
obviously thank you for listening and so where does this leave me going into 2025
well as I've mentioned in this episode many earlier the last year has been extremely
challenging for me I know there are far worse predicaments to be in than the mine
which is only too obvious every time we turn on the tv or peer into the social sphere or
read the news but one way or another I've arguably experienced the worst period of mental health of
my whole life certainly the most extreme or profound but I'm still here and there are many
positives for example I started a podcast hurrah I discovered what an amazing support network I have
both family friends new friends old friends I have had so much support and thank you all
if any of you are listening to this and all my artistic friends both here and and down south
and overseas and I I can't express enough how touching and incredible the support and help I've
received is and and I don't really know how I can repay everyone but I shall try and obviously
my wife and kids have been incredible and part with me and so thank you for them you're all
beautiful and wonderful and I love you all and hopefully I'll I'll have the the mental capacity
and energy to to repay the favor to every one of you in the coming year or two other positives
well I've learned a hell of a lot over the last year about myself about podcasting about art
about the just the world in general and I love learning so that's been amazing I have a
permanently changed world view it's opening up lots of new opportunities for me to explore that
I never even dreamt I would have I didn't ever think I would be doing something like this
and hopefully all of that will help me maintain my mental health and also not to return to this
fugue state that I've been in for the last five years because my mental health problems didn't
just suddenly spring up and in winter 2024 though they were really ongoing and building up to their
zenith at that point and I need to make sure I don't go back to the state that I was in before
because it really wasn't helpful and so here's to 2025 hopefully it'll be a little less traumatic
for me than 2024 may you all have the right sort of interesting times and the best of mental health
for 2025 and may you also all find endless time to be creative as for this podcast I have two more
interviews in the can yes two the first of which will be with you very shortly both those interviews
are really really good um really really inspiring I have a long list of subject areas I'm going to
cover I'm only really just getting started with all of this stuff and every time I let my brain
run freely I come up with a whole bunch of new things I want to cover I've actually got a backlog
of material and I'm raring to do even more so you're not going to get rid of me quite yet
I've also got some new episode formats I'm going to try out so watch this space
