# Episode 38: Sharing is Caring...Amen, Brother! - Significant Quotes

## Opening Philosophy
> "Why? Because sharing is caring and this is a podcast about both of these things."

## Personal Identity and Art
> "I'd always felt a little like a person made up of bits of other people, none of which seemed to fit comfortably together and that I'm tall, have a latently intimidating aura, essentially resting bitch face of the entire being and also tend to say and do things that make other people uncomfortable."

> "This image presented itself as an obvious contender both in terms of subject and tone. It worked well in multiple different sizes and would be memorable, so I started using it without giving it much more thought."

## Copyright Awakening
> "I was latently aware of this being a potential problem, but largely wafted it psychologically away as probably not mattering, because the film is so old and who's going to give a toss about an irrelevant little mental health podcast that probably no one will ever listen to anyway."

> "It struck me as possible that I might get pursued via potentially more detrimental avenues that would seem my modest little show eradicated from the web. This may seem a little hyperbolic and probably is, but as a law-abiding citizen and lifelong paranoiac I felt compelled to act if only slowly, you know, to stick it to the man good and proper."

## Creative Process and Resources
> "What I wanted was relatively simple, some signature music and some rendition of the podcast title. I needed it to be 10 to 20 seconds long and have a fade out that could be crossfaded with the start of the episode proper."

> "I wanted to put my own mark on it and give it a bit more of a modern sheen without violating its degraded dusty majesty."

> "Now I want you to note at this stage that I have thus far only used stuff that is either freely available or something or part of something that I already own. So no money has been expended, which is good because I ain't got any."

## Open Source Philosophy
> "The concept of sharing for the greater good is not only in the DNA of open source development, but is enshrined in law by the licensing. This is essentially anathema to the uber capitalist and the tragedy of the commons crowd, but screw those blowhards."

> "I don't like paying for software and I can't really afford to anyway."

## The Amen Break
> "What you just heard is arguably the most important six seconds of music ever recorded. Seriously. You've probably heard it about a thousand times in one form or another."

> "The use of the A-Men break and other samples highlights a relentless DIY creativity of the early hip-hop scene. One of the most inventive and important movements in music history."

## Tragic Stories
> "In August 1925, while assisting her husband in filling their automobiles gasoline tank, she was burned after splashed gasoline was ignited by the candle she was holding. She died in a Chicago hospital two days later." (About Edna Hicks)

> "He said it was unlikely that Coleman who died homeless and destitute in 2006 realized the impact he had made on music." (About Gregory Coleman)

## Copyright Philosophy - Key Quote
> "Over-protecting intellectual property is as harmful as under-protecting it. Culture is impossible without a rich public domain. Nothing today, like nothing since we tamed fire, is genuinely new. Culture, like science and technology, grows by accretion, each new creator building on the works of those who came before. Over-protection stifles the very creative forces it's supposed to nurture." (Judge Alex Kaczynski)

## Personal Ethics and Contradictions
> "I recognize that my use of chat GPT on this and other episodes seems a little hypocritical. However, I do not use these tools for creative uses and much of what I get from them is factual information that's freely available from websites such as Wikipedia."

> "As you can see, it's possible to be on both sides of this at the same time. Both the violator and the violated, the criminal and the victim."

> "In the meantime, feel free to copiously call me a hypocrite because I probably am."

## Complex Reality
> "Copyright is a dense, thorny bush of impenetrable language and unfathomable laws."

> "I set out to take a leisurely and somewhat light-hearted sojourn into this perilous arena and realised too late that I'd not stumbled into a friendly badminton knock-around, but more like a free-for-all ice hockey brawl where only some players are allowed to wear protective gear."

## Final Advice
> "I guess my advice here is to largely forget about it all. Just keep it all in mind when either making your own work available or borrowing from someone else's work. Always stay true to the spirit of sharing is caring while remaining ready to protect yourselves against cynical or bad faith attacks on your rights."

> "Every creative act stands on the shoulders of giants, each of which stands on the shoulders of giants in a regress that stretches back thousands of years and probably longer."
