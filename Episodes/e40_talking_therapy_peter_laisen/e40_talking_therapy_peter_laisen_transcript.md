Nobody give me sin for this
That's reason why I try both
If all is cold I can see a thousand times all day
Ask against mental illness
The charity is run by a Danish guy who lived in Scotland called Peter Leisen
who also owns a picture house and intends to restore it to its former glory in the coming years
At some point a couple of years ago Peter was on the hunt for people who could help him build this arts charity
and I put my hand up
I've since been on a whirlwind journey that has seen us become collaborators and close friends
and us delivering some stuff that I thought I'd never be able to do
This interview was originally recorded just to get his thoughts down on what the crew was and what it represented
But listening back to this I was blown away by the spirit, optimism and ambition here and I wanted to share it
It's a great interview and not just of local interest
I've been banging on for years now that the antidote to the widespread social divisions that we observe
pretty much everywhere at the moment is community and cooperation
By creating bonds on shared issues and activities we can build bridges between ourselves and those who may have different backgrounds and opinions from us
As a community we can generate optimism and action and work together to fight the ills of society
while also forging lasting friendships and bringing something positive, inclusive and fresh to the world
It could be via sports, caring the community, gardening, gaming, spirituality, inclusivity, the arts or all the above
The point is the community, the relationships and the webs we spin that bind us together
So go out there, find an organisation that suits you and your particular proclivity
and get involved, be it online or in the real world
This is the story behind the community that I found in the words of its founder
I hope you enjoy it
I intend to do a few more episodes on creativity in the community in the coming months
So watch this space
I'll see you soon, bye
I've always driven up and down the high street here
and wondered what this building was all about
It was looking a bit different from anything else
I've always been curious
And then when the for sale sign came up, that was the first time I realised, alright, okay, this is now changing hands
It's always been boarded up for about 10 years
So I've always wondered what was going to happen
The first time I went up for sale, I wasn't in a position to really do anything about it
But I subsequently learned that when I went up for sale and was up for auction sale
On the day of the sale, the building got listed
So a local group of people had canvassed for trying to get the council to list the building
And it was listed on the day of the auction, so the auction sale fell through
Chris, the previous owner, then wondered what to do
And a year later, so he essentially put it back up for auction as a listed building
And that's really when I saw it again, booked a viewing
And I remember it absolutely vividly
Going in and walking up the main staircase, the feature staircase, up into the projection room
And I opened the two doors into the gallery
And I just remember being absolutely blown over
With the fact that this amazing 1926 Art Deco cinema was hidden behind this
To most kind of nondescript frontage hook
But the amazing thing is, it's been in the same family for 60 years
It has started to dilapidated somewhat
But it has been looked after, and there's very little we can't see
The original bones of the building, the original colours, the original carvings, features, light fittings
It's all there
So I just remember looking and thinking, oh my god, it's like stepping 100 years back in time
And I really got that feeling up my spine
And that's when I realised that I should try to preserve this
I put my bed in for the auction, and I won the auction
So I was the happy owner of a 1926 Art Deco small town cinema in Oxford Island
So that's really where the journey began
So the first thing you do when you suddenly have a building like that
And you start to say, what can we do?
And you start a feasibility study
And that's really when we realise the history of the building
So if I take you back to 1926 when it was built
So it was a cinematic kind of entrepreneurial time
More and more business people realised there was a market for purpose built picture houses before then
There had been cinema in community halls, and scouts halls, and churches and so on
But there wasn't really purpose built
So it was built with a couple of retail units
It had a tea room upstairs
And you'll see in some of the press, it was like a palace
They described it as a palace
And remember this was Art Deco, it was like post international exhibition in Paris
So it wasn't actually like a modern cinema, which is essentially a black box
This was a cinema in pastel colours and Art Deco design
And a cream carved ceiling in Preston
Which is like an 1860 American kind of design
It very quickly became the hub of the community
That's where people met, that's where people socialised
They got the news from the cinema
And it was genuinely, genuinely like an anchor point for the community
So back in 1926, it was silent movies
So the first film that was shown in the picture house were the Gold Rush with Charlie Chaplin
And there is a musicians' pick in the cinema
We don't quite know if there was actually musicians or piano players sitting playing down there
But back in the 1920s, the first period of the cinema's life would have been silent movies with live music
People would come in, they would get the news
They would sing the national anthem at the end of the shows
People would sneak out quickly to avoid having to sing it
And then in the early 30s, and if you look in the cinema
You'll see there's a sound chamber behind the original screen
That wasn't there in the beginning, so that was in the early 1930s
Where the speakeas suddenly became a thing
And obviously colour as well
So colour and sound were introduced over a period of time
And being a new cinema, obviously you had to upgrade
So in the early 1930s, the Octolara cinema became a speakeas cinema
And then the following couple of decades were really the prime for cinema ever
It was the boom of Hollywood
It was just incredible, the amount of films that were made
And in 1946, in the UK, 32 million people went to the cinema every single week
So if you take the elderly and the babies out of that total population number
And see, actually, almost a full population went to the cinema every single week
Which is just incredible
Well this was before common ownership of televisions, right
People would be able to sit at home with the wireless
But they couldn't watch things
This was the only place they could go and watch the things that were coming out of Hollywood
Absolutely, I mean, mainly Hollywood
But obviously, I mentioned Hollywood because it was the heyday of Hollywood
But there was actually booming cinema and film production everywhere
It was worldwide at sorts
But you're actually right, and to be honest
The TV was what eventually had to kind of affect all the cinemas
So in the Octolara Picture House, or the Regal as it was called at that point
Was sold to the Antiques family in 1962
And that was as a direct result of the TV coming into more and more homes
Numbers of people going to the cinema was reducing
And all cinemas had to kind of figure out what to do next
Some cinema survived and continued as cinemas
Some cinemas were converted to bingo halls
If you look across the country, if you go into a bingo hall
It's very likely there is a false ceiling
And if you pop your head through the false ceiling
Above that, you'll probably see an old cinema
So that was how most cinemas were converted into bingo halls
For this particular one in Octolara
There was a survey of the local population
And the rumor has that actually it was really in favor of keeping the cinema
Or having a bingo hall
But the Lord promised we're having none of the idea of having a bingo hall in Octolara
And so it was kind of shelved
So the thing I haven't really talked about is why build it
Because it's lovely to preserve an amazing old 1926 cinema
And to be honest, that is the romance of this project
To be able to restore something back to exactly how it was
For the original purpose
And we can do that because we can see everything that was there
So that is amazing
But it's only amazing if it does something for the local community
And the people that it touches
So we set up the Octolara picture house crew
Which is essentially going to be the charity that is going to run this place
And the idea is that when we get the building refurbished
And we run it as a venue
An amazing historic venue with two auditoriums
A restaurant, a bar, a cafe, two retail units
An art library and multi-use space towards the back
Then all the profits from this place will go into outreach work
And outreach work for what?
Well, the Octolara picture house crew
Is a charity that wants to support anybody
Who needs or could benefit from a creative journey
And a creative journey can really be anything
Anything that supports that person
In terms of expressing themselves
Finding like-minded people
Getting camaraderies or new friends
A sense of belonging
And essentially also an opportunity to showcase what they do
Some people have very hidden talents
Sometimes there's prohibitors to people
Starting their creative journey in the first place
And actually just beginning to think about it or joining in
And suddenly it can go from strength to strength
And they can find tremendous pleasure
Some of it is about the outputs
It's lovely to obviously write a piece of poetry
And recite it in front of other people
Or it could be that somebody paints a picture
And again is brave enough to put it out there and get critiqued
But quite often it's being part of the process
Of actually creating the artwork in the first place
Creating the piece of poetry
Making a short film
An animation film
Or maybe carve a piece of wood
Or anything really
The latest group of creatives we have
Is a group that do miniature painting of warhammer
And dungeons and dragons
Mini figurines
And again that's a completely different kind of hobby
From some of the other things we did
But it's a lovely addition to what we do
So you take a very broad view of creativity
And so you're effectively
I mean go into what this practically looks like in a little bit
But effectively you're looking for people who just want to do stuff
So it could be ballet
It could be we've got obviously already got performance
But you've got writers
But pottery I don't know
Just chair making
I'm looking at a chair
So the point here is to support anyone who's doing anything creative
Regardless of their purpose
And to give them support on a platform
To either meet other people
To make their creations
Support them to make their creations
I imagine if someone wanted to make a film
A short film say
Might not have enough people
To help them make it
They might not have the right equipment
Or access to the right equipment
And so on
And the crew could put its weight behind
Supporting that person to deliver that
Maybe a bit of help with funding
Blah blah blah
And that's sort of the wider thing here
Someone just wants to learn how to do some watercolour
To someone who actually wants to make a movie
And it's sort of anything in between
That's exactly it
Because we have to realise
That we're all completely different people
And a creative journey for one person
Can be completely different from a creative journey for another
So we're not really trying to dictate
What the creative journey is
We're not really trying to dictate
How it starts
How it's developing
And how it's evolving into maybe
Multiple creative journeys
Or multi-disciplined creative journeys
What we really want to do is encourage people
Who might have an urge to do something
But don't do it
So why wouldn't they do something then, Conor?
It could be a confidence issue
It could, as you say, it could be a resource issue
It could be a knowledge issue
It could be just an absolute kind of
An anxiety issue of
If I actually start to do that
What will happen?
Will I not be able to pay my bills?
Will I find a dead end
And actually get depressed about it?
Will I be ridiculed?
Yeah, absolutely
There's a lot of kind of unknowns
When you try to do something
So our point is like
Trying to support, facilitate, enable
Remove prohibitors, remove barriers
And that can be simple things
That can be just creating an environment
That's actually welcoming
And that doesn't have prejudice
Or judge you
Or dictate to you anything
You can actually just come and participate
On your own agenda
Or your own kind of readiness
But then of course
If you then opt in
And participate in whatever capacity
Then we want to make sure that you can then
Expand on that initial engagement
And that can be that you either want to
Participate in more
It can be that you have an idea you want to do
So it requires materials, space
The teaching, coaching, mentoring
And then there's all the boring things that go with some of this stuff
If you do something and you
Want to show it something
You might need something like marketing
You know
If you organize an event
You need things like licenses
You need insurance
All these kind of things that for most people are
Not the strong point
It's not really core to what they're trying to do
And they have real prohibitors to
Actually just going on that creative journey that you want
So the crew is all about
Removing barriers, support
And facility and showcase
But what is the crew and what is its relationship
With the building of the cinema
The picture house
So the crew is a group of people
How do you think about it as an entity
I mean it's also a charity
So it's a registered charity
It's a registered charity
It's got four trustees
Who have got different skills
A lot of effort is clearly going into
The kind of the project of creating the picture house
But this is back to
Why do you create a cultural hub
A cultural kind of or a heritage centre
An art centre
That is clearly because you want to fill it with people that enjoy
Spending time there
So the crew is
Although it's a charity
They want to create a heritage centre
An art centre, a cultural centre
For Octorada and the community beyond
It is essentially about impacting people's lives
Making it a nice environment
And we're not ashamed of saying that
We are going to cheat the actual venue as a business
And try to run it as a profitable business
And then all the profits from their business
Will go into the charitable outcomes or purposes
Which is supporting people's creative journey
That is not necessarily happening on the premises
In the picture house
So the picture house is a vehicle
An income generating venture project
That will enable all these creative journeys
Either in the picture house
Because we're already hoping
That a lot of things will be showcased in the picture house
But actually it's glass root
Glass root kind of activities, workshops
That can happen anywhere
At the moment we do lots of events in the Aiden Hall in Octorada
We've done events in the churches
In collaboration with the scouts
And as it is right now
We are organising events and activities in the picture house
But obviously if that has to close
Because we want to regenerate it and renovate it
Then we will use all sorts of venues
Across the community area
To do all these activities
And so there's a group of volunteers already
There's quite a few
Some central core
You've obviously got the charity and the trustees
But on the grounds you've got
We'll come into the individual groups in a bit
But there is ultimately
There's a sort of a strata of leadership
And then a big pool of just people
Who have volunteered their time
And so that could be manning the door to an exhibition
It could be putting up display boards for an art exhibition
It could be doing the make-up for a theatre production
It could be doing the electrics or something
For a theatre production
So there's a group of people with a diverse set of skills
Who have all, either regularly or one point or another
Given their time freely
To support something the crew is doing
Absolutely
The crew is only the crew
Through all the wonderful people that give up their time
To support their activities
And naturally
As we talked about earlier
We're not prescribing anything
We're not dictating how things are run
So anybody can come along
And kind of come up with a good idea
Come up with a discipline that they would like to do
So some people will have leadership skills
They are driven
They might have a real desire to help others
And shape a program
So we have been really fortunate over the last two, three years
That we have been able to launch like dedicated programs
For certain disciplines
And you're absolutely right
There's leaders within those disciplines
They have kind of taken charge
And they are making things happen
Within that discipline, whatever it is
There are activities, events
And they, quite often
They're either led by the leaders
Or maybe somebody who is what we call an events leader
Or an activity leader
So to give you an example
Within the arts community
The crew art
We have a leadership team
And they kind of look at the capabilities
The strategic kind of approach to everything
I guess they kind of verify that everything is sensible
And achievable and so on
But in terms of actually carrying out lots of the activities
That can be any number of people stepping up
And saying I'll take charge of this
I will lead this group
I will teach this group
Or I will organize this
And then get other people to come and help
Underneath the leaders
There is a large group of volunteers
Who simply just want to be part of something
That is clearly good for people
They enjoy other people's company
There's a real camaraderie
We know we're doing something really good for a lot of people
We can see that the overall scope of the program is expanding
We can see more and more people participating
And that's just so joyful for so many people
And there is such a variety because of some people
They would like to be really practical
They might be
We talked about the drama group
There's so many different things
There's a makeup
There's costumes
There's props
There's all the technology
Lighting
Video
So there's lots of different things
But if you actually want to become an actor
Or maybe do write a piece
Then that's more creative
But actually you can be part of a creative team
With being practical with your hands
And maybe be behind the scenes
But actually making it happen
So there's a role for so many different kind of people
And again, we have volunteers
Youngsters, kids that are volunteering
And we have lots of people right into their late retirement
As you suggested, there's no restriction here
A lot of the people who join up to do some level of volunteering
Have no prior experience in any of the arts
That they're helping with
And it's not in the least bit an entry criteria
It happens to be an arts-based program
But it's to bring anyone in
Whether they've got any experience
Or any interest in experience
Because we put on the art exhibitions
And we said there's going to be refreshments
So we had volunteers manning the refreshments
And so anyone can come along, right?
Yeah, and some people have a prior career
A prior speciality
And obviously if they can offer that to the charity
As a volunteer or as a program leader
Or as an events leader
I mean, that is magical
Because clearly if you get some very competent people
They are able to pass on their competencies to others
And that can only be a good thing
But equally, you know, a lot of people come along
And do something for the first time
And that's the beginning of them learning about that
And growing in confidence and so on
And the other thing is the kind of idea that
You come along, you grow in confidence
You grow in skills
And then suddenly you become the one that is passing on to others
Or maybe take charge of a certain thing
Because you're now under the skin of whatever you're doing
And now you can actually lead others
But there's really no specific way of getting involved
And that's the whole point
We want to try to be as inclusive and open and accessible
Most of what we do is completely free as well
We want to make sure that that is not the financial situation
Of anybody's private kind of economy
That should stop them participating, you know
A good example was back to our miniature painting class
That requires some equipment
It requires some materials and so on
And we provided that
So anybody who comes along
Have a try before they can come
And they don't have to do anything
They don't have to buy anything
They want to bring anything
And they can literally come and try it out
Yeah, a mohammer is expensive
I can imagine, it sounds like a brand
But my point is they all said maybe next to somebody
Who has been in that hobby for five years
And has spent a lot of money on it
And can spend a lot of money on it
And they might be very ambitious
They might go to exhibitions with it
But again, mixing that up
And having an environment where people at different levels
Can sit side by side
And enjoy the hobby together
And enjoy inspiration
That's what it's really about
I mean we've had people in
Obviously my side's on the art, the art exhibition side
But people who have come along
And they're just turning up to man
Just to man the doors or something
And you know, no, I'm not an artist
I've got no previous, I just want to help out
And then they do that a couple of times
You end up chatting to them
And they go, yeah, I've been drawing for years
Or I've been painting for years
And it's like, okay, so you are an artist
And no, no, no, I'm not an artist
And people don't think of it that way
Like, I do this as my hobby
You do that, you must be professional
And it's not really like that at all
And I think that even being involved in that experience
People see that actually, oh no, they're the same as me
I could be doing this too
And I think there's a lot of people out there
And I can use my area
But I guarantee the people involved in the theatre
And all of these things, people will turn up
And don't really see themselves as part of that
Suddenly become part of it
And they already had the skills
And some of the things these people turn up with, you know, blows my mind
You know, I mean, how could you say you're not an artist
You know what I mean
And I think people sometimes just need to permission
They need to be in an environment whereby they can just pipe up
And say, well, actually, I do do a bit of this
Can I show you something? And it's safe
And it's open
And sometimes they'll turn up with something that's, okay
You're quite a beginner at this, but that's an opportunity
Let's grow you
Or sometimes someone turns up with something amazing
And just like, wow, how can we get this out in front of the public
And I think, you know, it's that
We almost think about it like a pipeline
But I think, you know, taking the more holistic view, as you're saying
If we can get someone in to come and just help out a bit
With some carpentry on the theatre
They may be young and end up doing that as a career
You know, that's what it's for, right?
Absolutely
And don't get me wrong
The crew's very ambitious
So we like to do things well
And I mean, you mentioned the theatre element of the crew
So crew drama
And we've invested a lot of money in making it really, really good
And that includes a lot of technology
And technology is obviously very exciting
There's so much to do, video, audio, lighting, control
And absolutely, there are future careers to be discovered
By getting involved and being supported
And that is very important
And when I say future careers
It's not just for kids or youngsters
I mean, that could be any time in your life
Where suddenly you get exposed to something
And you think, this is great, this is something I really enjoy
This is actually making me smile when I get out of bed
Because I need to go and do this and I really enjoy it
And I mean, I don't know me personally
I've never been to a stand-up as such
But obviously we now, through crew words, launched Stands Alone
Which is like an open mic night every last Wednesday of the month
And I remember sitting in on the first one
So people go up, they get five minutes of fame
So you book a slot
And you can recite poetry, you can recite the story
You can tell jokes, you can sing a song
It doesn't really matter
Some people do all of that
I was totally blown away
Because I'd never been in that environment
And the variety was just insane
Just some people was how they felt that day
Other people had an angle on something from their work
Or their family or a holiday
And they were reflecting on these things
And I was actually blown away
And I haven't been brave enough myself
To go up in front of the mic for five minutes yet
But I'm actually considering what should I do
Because I want to go up there and say my thing
And I remember people sitting in the audience
Who were not on the list
So they had come to the event
They were not on the list to do something
But they got so inspired that they went up in the break and said
Do you know what, I've got something on my phone that I've written
Can I go and perform it as well?
So it has this real kind of energy and synergy about it
And I bet you, when people walk back from events like this
You are creatively stimulated
You can't wait to do something, do you?
Well, and it raises an interesting point that we haven't really covered yet
Which is, for one of the better terms, the audience
And so obviously you're putting on arts-based stuff
But it wouldn't be much of a theatre show if no one turned up to see it
It wouldn't be much of an art exhibition if no one came in
And so obviously the art exhibition has been going on for quite a long, longer
We've had many, many hundreds of people through the door for over ten local art exhibitions with local artists
And obviously the people who turned up for your cinema nights
The people who came to the theatre
People who turned up for stands alone
And as you say, some of them have turned up for entertainment
And that's all they want
But others, the spectres of cinema was such an incredible, ambitious production
And so many people saw it from the local community
And this is what's good advertising, right?
Well, I mean, spectres of the cinema
So it was really apt because they actually told the story of the cinema
So it was the story of the manager
It was the story of the pianist
It was the story of the orchorettes
It was the story of the people that actually went to the cinema
We had the architect there
We had the entrepreneur, a bit of clear
We had the doorman
We had the ticketing offers
You know, we had all the people that had been in the cinema back in the day
And we told their story
And yeah, it was very ambitious
We had a lot of people coming through
It was a production in a dilapidated building
You know, so everything that we put in for the production was essentially a pop-up
But incredible quality
I'm sure everybody will agree
And the fact that we had to put more tickets on after the first week
We realised we could fit a wee bit few or more people in
And so we, after the first night, it was six shows over two nights
Or three nights, two shows a night
So we had the first two shows, realised we could put a few more in
And they just sold out straight away
Which is, again, the word of mouth
And the fact that, oh, actually, there's something good, you know
And this is the other thing
When people invest time, they can be to go along
And nib in for 15 minutes to watch some pictures in an art exhibition
Or to say, I'll go along
And watch a drama production for an hour, an hour and a half
Or come and watch a film at our cinema weekends
It's all about making sure when people leave that they think, that was really worth it
I'm really glad that I spent that amount of time on this
That was spent better this way than most other things I could have done with my time
And that's what it's really about
It's about making sure that people have really good experiences
And that we exceed expectations
And I think what we have seen so far is
We do exceed expectations
Because, actually, there is an incredible amount of talent
And if you make an effort to showcase it, to facilitate it, to house it
Then, honestly, it is a real treat
So several of the actors in the species of cinema are members of the drama group
These guys are retirees who never acted before
And never considered being part of a drama
They're not old thespians, as they were
And so that, for me, is the concept in motion
In that hundreds of people came to see a show
And some of those people were only acting in that show because of the existence of crew
Yeah
And some of the young ones as well, right?
Absolutely
But what's really amazing is there's a real momentum now, a real excitement
I mean, the drama group is now looking at a two-year plan
Trying to see how much they can fit in without overdoing it, you know
And I know, for instance, one of the young actors is now writing a play
So that's another thing
It's an amateur actor
But he's so inspired about what is possible
When you actually get the support to put on a real production
That he said, well, I actually want to go and write my own play now
It was a new discipline for him
But he's got the right people around him
They'll support him
And I've heard some feedback and it's coming along fantastic
So there we go
Somebody who has never thought of writing themselves suddenly finds the confidence to do it
When we first met, when you were looking for people to do anything, really, under the crew banner
And I said, well, I've done some art exhibitions
When I lived down south in Windsor
So maybe we could try doing that
And I've got some artwork
So I didn't know any artists locally
I'd only lived here for a couple of years
And I didn't really know how I was going to do it
I just was part of a group down south
And so I had very low expectations of what we were going to do
But I was like, well, I've got to do something, right?
I've got all these artworks
I want to show you them
There must be other artists around here, but I didn't know anything
And so we started talking about this
And in my mind, we were going to have two or three artists
And hope that some people would turn up
And the art group down south, sometimes we'd do art exhibitions
And three people would come in
And so there were more artists than there were punters
But that was in February that year
By May that year, we put on the first exhibition
We had 10 artists
These gargantuan display boards with their own lighting
And we got 500 or 600 people in
And I was just stood there in the corner of this place
With my artworks up on my panels going, what the hell just happened?
Because if it had just been what I said, that would have been cool
I would have been happy with that
That's what I had in mind
What we delivered, and then we delivered another three, four times
Was a professional exhibition
And I never dreamed I would be doing that
I just didn't dream I'd be doing that
I've got a lot of confidence in my ability as an artist
But not in my ability to deliver art exhibitions
Hell no, I'm like practically phobic of organisation
So we talked, that was the first sort of big project that we did
That you put on
And I think it really goes to show
It's like, don't do things by half
Make it high quality
Do it properly
And everyone is elevated
And now there's a big community of artists
25 plus artists have all contributed
And displayed many thousands of pounds have been made by art being displayed
Some of that money's gone back into the crew
And it's a sort of virtuous cycle
And then obviously we put on the open studios
Where we opened the whole of the cinema
With 30 artists last year, last autumn
With many hundred people through the door
With our artworks all in the auditorium
And having our artworks shown in that space was absolutely incredible
And then about a month later you transform the place for spaces of cinema
So if anyone listening to this is under any illusions
There's no ambition
I think you should think again
Yeah, there is a lot of ambition
It's funny how words have got certain connotations
Ambition could be a frightening word for some of you
And that's the thing that the crew is all about
Is trying to have ambition at the same time as
You know, being absolutely down to earth
Open-minded, accessible and inclusive
Because this is not about showing off
This is about putting the best foot forward
It's about making an impression
It's about when you ask people to spend time
Whatever it is, volunteering, coming along as a punter
You know, if people invest time
You almost have a duty to try your best
And that's what this is about
And that's a good lesson in life as well
To actually put your best foot forward
Make it the best it can be
You don't need to measure against others
And this is the thing
Actually be happy in your own skin
Have small goals
Be pleased with what you achieve
There's another story because we also hosted two book festivals
One in 2023 and then again in November 2024
And again, the story is a wee bit the same as you described, Alex
I remember speaking to Kathleen and Kirsty
Who leads the kind of crew books
And they were talking about doing this book festival
In conjunction with the Coffee Morning in Zorn
It just grew and grew and grew
And the confidence about the project in Zorn grew
And we ended up having an amazing event with
Again, more than 20 authors were there
We had 12 different workshops
We had storytelling, creative writing, crime writing, poetry writing
It was just such a variety again
There's so many things for so many different people
And we had the kids in doing arts and crafts
And there was a real buzz about it
And you'll remember that we did our art exhibition
And I remember maybe a few kids, one for their parents
To get through all the paintings
And get out of the building at Zornaginal
Because they were a bit bored
And then we learned how to motivate the kids
And get the kids involved
And actually, two or three art exhibitions later
It was the parents that tried to drag the kids back out there after an hour
Because the kids were still in the zone
Doing their art, enjoying being there
So, you know, it's just fantastic
And on the book side and the author side and so on
We also really come a long way
Because last year in March, in 2024 March
We opened the Creative Hub in the actual cinema
Which is a more permanent kind of space and environment
Where crew books have created like a second hand bookshop
Which is really, really nice
It's just so cosy now
Open two days a week
And we obviously sell books
We take donations of books and so on
But the amount of activities that are here surprises
And a lot of people come in and just reflect on life
Have a cuppa, talk about literature
Clearly, the crew books is very closely linked to crew words
You know, so poetry, literature, storytelling
It's all interlinked, you know
So we've got this really nice space
Which is also used for lots of workshops
Either by the artist or for the creative writing class
Which is taking place here also
That's, again, a great wee place
And yeah, it's all going from strengths to strengths
Yeah, I mean, it's interesting
When you started talking about the picture house
Back in its heyday was a community hub
As much as it was a place to come and see movies
And almost we've come back full circle now
And, you know, it's a little bit more modest at the moment
Until the development's done
But there is this hub where people can come
And it doesn't have to be about the books
You can just come and hang out and chat
And exchange ideas and stuff
We've talked about crew arts quite a lot
You've got anything to add to that?
Well, crew art was the first group that formed under
By Through Yourself, Alex, you know
And it kind of, I guess we learned a lot from that
You know, how to go on this journey together
And I know you, and thanks for saying, you know
You're overwhelmed with the first exhibition, you know
But we made it better along
And we realized there's different ways to do things
And different audiences and so on
So that's done from stretch to strength
I mean, interestingly, one of my learnings about that
Because, you know, I've had a bit of a choppy couple of years
And my mental health has been extremely variable
And I think one of my learnings about it all was
A, yes, I can do it almost regardless of what state I'm in
And B, my ambition is only really limited by me, right?
And so, you know, I've had to dial it back a bit to catch my breath
Because we did so much up to autumn last year
And I just needed to stop and just mend myself
But it's that sense that, well, when I can come back to this
When I can really get my head back into it
I'm only limited by my ambition, right?
That, you know, if we can do anything like we did at the end of last year
Then, you know, I don't even know
I've done how you taught that, right?
So, yeah, I mean, I think it's really, really exciting
The art group has also done some amazing other things
So we collaborate with other groups within the community
And to mention a few, we've collaborated with the Rotary Young Competition
So young artist, young photographer, young writer
And they run also young musician and young sports person of the year
And you'll remember when we did the exhibition last year
We took all the entries from the young artist and young photographer competitions
And we framed all their work and we actually put it on display
So that was a really nice way of giving a bit to that competition
And seeing the youngsters coming in with their parents to see their art on the wall
And we also collaborated with the local community school
And we've actually helped them do arts classes within the school and within the curriculum
I think expressive arts is not funded particularly well nowadays
And actually it's quite sad to hear how the schools are struggling with resources
Struggling with teachers and classrooms and so on
So the fact that we can assist them in making the whole faculty better
And give kids a chance to actually get inspiration from creative arts and expressive arts is really important
So we're doing great there
And also to exhibit with or meet professional artists and see that this is a viable path for them
So we're bringing this to a close outside of the redevelopment of the cinema
What's the ambitions for the crew specifically?
Maybe the next 12 months or so
So we are a very young charity
We've only been a registered charities for the last year
We're building our foundation for everything we do
We do have our vision and it's a difficult vision
But the vision is that we would want to spend as little money as possible ever on administration
So when we look at charities across the country
Some are amazing and they spend 100% of their income fundraising
On the charitable purpose
Others are spending half of what they make on making more administration, red tea
And we really want to become a charity that spends 100% of our profits
100% of our fundraising on our charitable outcomes
Why is that hard?
It's hard because obviously if you don't have employees
If you don't have a back office that is professional and paid for doing what they do
It is a wee bit harder to drive things, keep to deadlines and so on
And that's the kind of challenge that we are working through
But our vision is that 100% of our money should go to the charitable purposes
And our volunteers are helping us do that
That's why our volunteering is so amazing
But clearly there are some administrative things in the background and so on
And we are working through that and trying to make sure that we can actually deliver these ambitious plans
Without suddenly getting bogged down in paying for too much administration
But the vision is to keep going
Keep collaborating across our groups
Keep getting more and more people involved
Making sure people are supported, excited, inspired
And then God knows where it will take us
I think we have a really good thing going here
And we will obviously push that as far as we can in our local community
But it's like anything, if you do something well, if something works
Other people can copy it and then potentially do it
So if we find that something has worked really well
Then we want to share our knowledge with others
We might even share some of our infrastructure with others
To make sure that this charitable purpose is as far reaching as we can make it
But obviously right now it's all about just getting our group together
Getting our leaders supported
Getting our events and activities and leaders supported in what they do
And making sure our volunteers enjoy being part of this
And we are always welcoming more volunteers if people want to come along
It's a great group to be part of
And yeah, we'll just go from strength to strength
I mean in terms of plans
I probably was only really asking ironically since we started 2024
With some pretty well defined plans
And didn't do any of them
But we did some of them
But what we delivered was arguably big and more ambitious
And some of the stuff that was delivered at the end of the year
Simply didn't exist in our brains at the beginning of the year
And so there's not just ambition, there's speed
And it's dynamic and it's ever changing
And new stuff's being brought in all the time
So yeah, I'm sure it's going to be another exciting year
If people want to get involved, what should they do?
So anybody can get involved
As I say, we have four categories of ways to get involved
One is if you know about a discipline
Know about an activity
You think that would be a great thing to do
You have some know-how, you can maybe take the lead on it
Then we would love you to get in touch and say
I would like to do X, Y and Z
This is what I think is involved
Will you support us?
And I can't always say the answer will always be yes
But if it is about supporting people's creative journeys
Removing barriers and be completely inclusive
The answer is probably yes
So if you have a dream of bringing something to others
Then we will support you
If you are interested in any of the groups we already have
But don't quite want to be the leader
But actually can participate as an event leader, activities leader
Then come along, step forward, help us deliver our programmes
Make sure you showcase your talent, pass it on to others
That would be amazing
So we have our programme leaders and then our events and activities leaders within each group
But then we have this massive group of volunteers who makes everything happen
It is a great group to be part of
You can choose to be involved as much as you want
Some people are just occasionally part of the team
Others are there all the time
It is entirely up to you
There is such a variety of things to do
It can be anything from opening the door, welcoming people
Shifting out, building exhibition walls
It can be catering, teas and coffees
It can be clearing up
It can be anything really that we need to do
So volunteering
And then you can participate
You don't actually need to be a volunteer or a leader
You can just participate
Keep in touch, look what we are doing
Make sure you support the activities
So if you do an architect exhibition
Come, speak to the artist, encourage the youngsters
You know, that is part of the wellbeing of everybody as well
That actually the audience has come
And they are excited and they participate and they engage
And so, brilliant, thank you for that
