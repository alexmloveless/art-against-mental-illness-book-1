# Episode 29: Talking Therapy with Rob Parkinson - Significant Quotes

## Nature and Mental Health

### "Flat Horizon Deficiency"
> "I found that when I came back to Bournemouth just for one visit I went to visit the sea and the coast and I suddenly felt this incredible weight lifting off me and I didn't realise at the time but I'd been becoming really depressed in London. I had been really feeling it as not being in nature, not having natural surroundings. There were no flat horizons in London, everything is broken up. It was quite a thing that I found. As soon as I saw the flat horizon of the sea it was the first time I'd seen that since two years and I just realised that that's something that I really needed in my life. I actually coined the phrase flat horizon deficiency."

### Environmental Mental Health Needs
> "So if you live in cities and towns and everything and you don't have that flat horizon it can kind of bring you down and it's a massive boost when you do get that."

## Creativity and Life Philosophy

### Creative Necessity for Mental Health
> "I need to be creative and I was starting to put quite a few things together knowing that yes I need to be in nature or around close to nature especially the sea and I need to be creative more than just for an hour or two in the evening so I have to finish my work."

### Art as Life Maintenance
> "So it's a huge thing for me and it's something that's set in stone for life for me now. I'll always be painting. I'll always be making music. And I have to keep remembering that if I do stop doing it, the ladder is presented in front of me and I can either go down it or I can stop creating again."

### Creative Process as Mental Health Indicator
> "So it's a fantastic kind of like benchmark to know if you start feeling a bit dawdy with yourself, then stop what you're doing and go and paint the picture."

## Life Transitions and Risk-Taking

### Van Life Decision
> "I got to the point where I realised that I was spending more time in my camper van over the week than I was in my really nice flat that I had and I kind of thought this is this is now something that I thought about and I thought I could move into my van, I could move into it full time and it would cost me a hell of a lot less than what I'm spending."

### Daily Painting Project Genesis
> "So I tried to sort of come up with an idea of thinking how can I come up with a plan to creatively fund my lifestyle and I've always been into painting since I was very young... If I just came up with one painting every day and then put them online and if people bought them and I was making, even if it was just 15 or 20 pounds a day for each one of those paintings then that would be enough for my food, my fuel and whatever I needed."

### Career Transformation Speed
> "By the middle of February I was earning the same amount that I was earning at my full-time job so I spoke to my employers and I thought and I asked them and I said is it okay if I just hammer notice it, give two weeks and can I just go and they gave me their blessing and said of course so I worked out my two weeks at the job and by the end of February I left my job when I found myself in the position of being a full-time painter which was a dream come true."

## Crisis and Recovery

### Van Accident Impact
> "That was devastating. I feel extremely lucky that neither myself and my girlfriend got any serious damage, ourselves or injuries but my van was completely written off. It was totaled. Bear in mind, it was my pride and joy anyway but the history behind that vehicle was more than just a ban to me. It had been my home for years, it had been the beginning of a project. Yeah, I did lose it quite badly after that."

### Depression Following Loss
> "I was very good on the outside, I kept it together on the outside but on the inside I started to go downhill quite quickly... After the crash I practically stopped painting. I wasn't earning much money... I didn't have that spark of creativity. I felt I'd lost it."

### Recovery Through Return to Art
> "But when I was in that coach I found that coming back again and I started painting a lot more. Again, I was so lucky that my customers and people that were seeing the paintings were still there and they still wanted to buy and I started making a bit of money again, which was great."

## South West Coast Path Experience

### Mental Health Recovery Through Walking
> "I couldn't believe it because within a few days I'd walked 40 miles along that coast and I felt myself starting to get a bit fitter. And amazingly, and this is the most important thing, is I felt a massive amount of relief. All the stress and the pressure and the things that had happened previously had just been lifted off me like a weight. It's a bit of a cliche, but I felt alive. I felt enthusiastic about what I was doing."

### Simple Happiness
> "Sitting in a field overlooking the sea and just watching the butterflies, just having a rest, drinking water. It's the simplest thing in the world. But I felt so happy knowing that I was doing the paintings and I had all of this experience to look forward to."

### Project Completion as Achievement
> "So for me, that really hit the nail on the head for my personal humble achievement that I set out to do. That I'd extend from having these mental health issues of depression, not knowing what to do with myself, suffering loss, going through that and thinking about creativity. That's how I get through. I need to be creative. I need to be doing something that is crazy. And if I'm not, I know that I will start to go back down that slope again."

## Business and Artistic Practice

### Market Discovery
> "I thought the best way to sell these, I don't want to put a price because I don't know what they're worth, I couldn't price the work so I decided just to put them on eBay and I set up an eBay account and I put all of the paintings on... I put them with no reserve, I put them at a star price of 99p and just let people bid on them and decide what they thought were worth."

### Artistic Legacy
> "I kept a pretty good catalogue over time. And I think it's total, it's just over 2,200 that I've painted and I've sold. So that's just over 11 years. Those aren't going anywhere. They'll continue to be there forever. So that's something that is amazing to think about. That's kind of like the legacy of where I've travelled to, where I've been. Because all of these paintings literally just document where I've travelled."

## Creative Community and Relationships

### Customer Relationships
> "Because when people do say that they love what you're doing. And they say, I gave that to my family member as a gift and they absolutely love it. That's a special place that you painted. And they've now got a permanent reminder of it from you. That's amazing. It's an amazing feeling. That makes you feel so good."

### Generous Support System
> "I feel incredibly lucky that I'm able to go practically anywhere, paint and essentially make a living from it. That's a rare thing in this day and age. And it's something I've really worked towards. I've worked very, very hard at. But it seems that the universe has kind of like shined on me a little bit. And I've had an incredibly wonderful and generous customer base that have really stopped buying it."

## Inspiration and Motivation

### Idea Formation Process
> "There was something in the back of my mind that is very strange when ideas manifest themselves. You get inspiration from different places. You don't just have an idea and go, I'm going to do that. You get a little bit of a fragment from here, a little bit of an inspiration from there. Those things start coming together and then this idea forms and manifests itself and literally just won't go away."

### Nature Connection
> "Special little things like a robin coming and sitting on a twig next to you. Thank you robin. You know, immortalising."

### Magical Moments
> "I went swimming in the sea, Brave Old Me in Scotland in a place called Montrose... And then the seal just popped up and was just staring at me. It was really weird. And then in the background, there was all these dolphins, like probably about a mile away, but you could see these dolphins cavorting in the ocean. It was quite simply one of the most magical moments of my life. I was like, this stuff doesn't happen, but it's all here folks in Scotland."

## Alex's Resonance

### Shared Experience
> "Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's the same for me. My studio is my refuge and I have to be painting. And when I'm not, I just descend really quickly. So I fully get that."

## Interview Meta-Commentary

### Alex's Introduction
> "So this is the third in my talking therapy sessions which are interviews with artists and creatives. This one's with Rob. He's a really, really interesting guy. He goes by the moniker, the painting Nomad. He doesn't stay in one place for very long and he's not technologically particularly up to date and therefore we had various challenges in recording this episode."

### Technical Challenges
> "But the sound quality is not good which is a real shame because this was such an interesting interview and he's a really interesting guy. But I believe you can hear everything. It's not always as clear as it could be in some places."
