*   The Art Against Mental Illness podcast interviews Rob Parkinson, aka the Painting Nomad, about his art and mental health journey.
*   Rob is a full-time oil painter who documents his travels through landscapes and seascapes.
*   He left a stressful nine-to-five job in Bournemouth after realizing he needed nature and creativity for his well-being.
*   Rob moved into a camper van in 2013 and started painting daily, selling his work online to fund his travels.
*   He found that being near the sea and having a "flat horizon" was crucial for his mental health, coining the term "flat horizon deficiency."
*   His daily painting project gained momentum, and he was able to quit his job and become a full-time artist.
*   The pandemic grounded him, and a van accident led to depression, but he recovered by moving into a coach and returning to painting.
*   Rob walked the 630-mile South West Coast Path, painting along the way and selling his art to fund the journey.
*   He held an exhibition of his coast path paintings, marking a significant personal achievement.
*   Painting and music are essential creative outlets for Rob to maintain his mental well-being.
*   He has painted and sold over 2,200 paintings, documenting his travels and experiences.
*   Rob can be found on his Facebook painting page (Rob Parkinson Painting) and his Etsy shop (The Painting Nomad).


Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. Hello everybody. So this is the third in my talking
therapy sessions which are interviews with artists and creatives. This one's with Rob. He's a really,
really interesting guy. He goes by the moniker, the painting Nomad. He doesn't stay in one place
for very long and he's not technologically particularly up to date and therefore we had
various challenges in recording this episode since we are located in different places.
And so after battling with technology for quite some time I ended up cobbling together a solution
so I could at least capture something. But the sound quality is not good which is a real shame
because this was such an interesting interview and he's a really interesting guy. But I believe
you can hear everything. It's not always as clear as it could be in some places. I lost him entirely
towards the end. He was just breaking up because of poor network. So if the off-ramp to this episode
seems a little bit cobbled and rushed and that's because I had to piece it together from what
little bits of communication we were able to. But otherwise I think it's a really amazing interview
so I hope you enjoy it. I have another interview lined up which will be out in the next week or two
so watch this space and otherwise I'll see you soon. Hello everybody I'm here with Rob Parkinson
aka the painting Nomad whose story is somewhat surprisingly even more interesting than his
moniker. Rob would usually be found rambling the highways and byways of the UK but since
it's late December he's someplace warmer than his usual home which is a tent. Hi Rob where are you
coming to us from today? I'm up in Durham, hi Alex. And how come you find yourself there? One of my
customers who used to be just a customer now is a very very good friend. He's collected quite a few
paintings and he had basically a spare house so him and his lady friend of his partner they got
together and moved into his house and her house was left spare and instead of renting it out
they've just sort of been sat on it. When I got to a point where last year I finished doing a
specific project and he just said if you want the keys to this house you can have them come and move
in look after it. So he was on the border of because it's near to Scotland and I was looking
to go into Scotland to do some work up there and it worked out perfectly and I've been here for
about a year now using it as a base going backwards and forwards to different places. And so it's nice
and warm and you're not that far from me so I'm guessing it's about as gloomy as it is outside
for you as it is for me. Why don't you tell us your story and why you usually find yourself in a tent?
It's quite a long story if I was to take about 11 years. I'm a full-time artist now, I'm a full-time
oil painter. I've been painting since 2014 full-time. Just to put it into context I paint
mainly landscapes, seascapes and it's kind of a documentary of my travels. That's the main
context and what I do and it kind of began around about 2014. I've been working in a job
for quite some time. I moved around quite a bit, I moved to London, I'd moved from an originally
born in Manchester but moved down to Bournemouth. So I was in Bournemouth at the time and I'd been
working for it. It was a really good job, I really enjoyed the company and I love the people that I
was working with but it was a nine-to-five, I was working full-time and I started to feel myself
getting very stressed with it. It was something that was, it was a kind of a grind that I found
a nine-to-five. I'm not very good at the nine-to-five thing. I've always been creative, I've always been
somehow involved in the arts from an early age. Mostly music as it goes in my very earlier days.
I was in bands quite a lot. I did move to London and I took up music professionally and I was
working making music for films. That was a main thing that I was doing in London which was
fantastic, I absolutely loved it. I do play several instruments and I do quite a crazy thing called
foley art which is making the sound effects for films. So when a door goes slam it's blocked with
two pieces of wood and a microphone. So if you imagine all the film sounds that you get, I did
that live. So it was making music and sound effects live to film. So that was a very cool
creative out for me and I loved it but living in London I found that that was very taxing.
The chaos of London, the hectic lifestyle, the fact that you can earn good money but you spend it
just as quick is a lot of pressure. I found that when I came back to Bournemouth just for one visit
I went to visit the sea and the coast and I suddenly felt this incredible weight lifting off me
and I didn't realise at the time but I'd been becoming really depressed in London. I had been
really feeling it as not being in nature, not having natural surroundings. There were no flat
horizons in London, everything is broken up. It was quite a thing that I found. As soon as I saw
the flat horizon of the sea it was the first time I'd seen that since two years and I just realised
that that's something that I really needed in my life. I actually coined the phrase flat horizon
deficiency. So if you live in cities and towns and everything and you don't have that flat horizon
it can kind of bring you down and it's a massive boost when you do get that.
So I made a conscious decision to move back to Bournemouth even though the London scene for me
was fantastic and I loved being in the music but I couldn't live with continually going down and
down so I moved and I was in this job and as mentioned it was brilliant company, brilliant
people but the nine to five I wasn't doing very well with it. It was grinding me down yet again
because I need to be creative and I was starting to put quite a few things together knowing that
yes I need to be in nature or around close to nature especially the sea and I need to be
creative more than just for an hour or two in the evening so I have to finish my work.
Now in 2013 I bought myself a camper van. I got a little VW T4 and I absolutely loved it. As soon
as I finished work I was jumping in that and going off exploring, I go to the beach, I go into the
forests, I put an old mattress in the back in a sleeping bag and some cooking stuff and I started
staying overnight in places and this was way back in 2013 before the major vandal I'd seen had
exploded which is massive now. This was at a time where people were kind of thinking I was a bit
of an idiot wanting to go out and live in my van for two or three days at a time but I loved it,
absolutely loved it and I got to the point where I realised that I was spending more time in my
camper van over the week than I was in my really nice flat that I had and I kind of thought this
is this is now something that I thought about and I thought I could move into my van, I could move
into it full time and it would cost me a hell of a lot less than what I'm spending. I mean it's
costing me a thousand pounds a month just to have a flat and essentially it was just a very expensive
storage unit, things that I didn't need or use. So another conscious decision I thought I'm going
to try this, I'm going to give my flat up, I'm going to move into my van and I literally over
the course of two months I handed my noticing to the landlord, I gave most of my possessions away
and I put a few special bits into storage and that was it. I moved into my van with
a couple of bin bags of stuffed bag of clothes, still had the old mattress in the back and a
cooking stove and off I went and I started living full time in my little camper van
but I was still going to work and I was still doing the nine to five things so I was hoping
to go back to that same base five days a week to keep up with the work and even though I was
having a fantastic time in the evenings, the weekend, I just realised that I needed to
be in that environment more, I needed to get away from the hamster wheel so to speak.
So I realised that my wages that I was earning I was saving quite a bit but I didn't need the money,
the only money that I needed was enough to get by, enough for food and fuel
and a little bit extra just in case and I thought I could get by on 300 pounds a month, I don't need
this big paycheck so why am I doing this job. So I tried to sort of come up with an idea of thinking
how can I come up with a plan to creatively fund my lifestyle and I've always been into painting
since I was very young. I got seriously into painting while I was in my late teens, early
20s and I did a lot of painting, got into oil painting especially, all quite abstract and quite
experimental but I did it a lot and I've always painted at some point and I thought I wonder if I
came up with this plan of painting a little painting, a little oil painting of wherever I
was traveling to in my camper van, could be the beach, could be the forest, it could be somewhere
away. If I just came up with one painting every day and then put them online and if people bought
them and I was making, even if it was just 15 or 20 pounds a day for each one of those paintings
then that would be enough for my food, my fuel and whatever I needed. So I planned that and I
put the date to say on the 1st of January 2014 I'm going to begin that project.
So I was only planning to stay in the van traveling around living in it over the summer
so I thought when it gets to winter it's just going to be obviously too cold. Back then you
couldn't get Chinese diesel heaters or it was very expensive to get a heater that time and I thought
if you'll get to the winter, see what it's like, I'll get to October but I realised that I'd have
climatised to the cold. It was quite a strange phenomenon. I didn't realise that you could
kind of like as soon as it starts gradually getting colder your body kind of gets used to it
and I did and everybody else was wearing thick coats and comforts and two pairs of trousers and
I was still walking around in the t-shirt shorts thinking it's just a bit strange but it's okay.
So I carried on into the winter and when it got to the 1st of January I had actually previously
told on Facebook and on the Facebook groups that I'm going to do this project of painting a day
and explained about it and I set up a blog with the help of a friend and on the 1st of January
I went to a New Year's Eve party at a pub in Dorset, famously the Square and Compass Pub,
the next morning around about midday I opened the back of the van up and I just painted a picture,
a little tiny seven inch by five inch oil painting of the fields surrounding the back of the car
pub and I thought I've actually done the first paint and I put that on the blog and I put it
online so here's painting number one and I did a little write-up as to what it was and where I'd
been, a little story behind it. The next day I did, we had the day off work because I was still
working at the time and I went off and I did another painting and the third day I had to go
to work, back at work again, but in the evening as soon as I finished I got back in the van and
the first thing I did was did another little painting, I actually painted seven that I found
on the path, so that was three and then four, five, six, seven paintings that got done and I
was continuously putting these online and writing up the blog, posting up paintings onto Facebook
and for my surprise it started to really gather momentum very very quickly
and a lot of people were messaging, getting in touch and then people did start to say,
are these paintings for sale, which for me was that was the holy grail of what I was looking for
and I thought the best way to sell these, I don't want to put a price because I don't know what
they're worth, I couldn't price the work so I decided just to put them on eBay and I set up an
eBay account and I put all of the paintings on, by the time I'd done that I had 10 paintings,
so I'd done 10 days, 10 paintings, I put them all on eBay, I put them with no reserve, I put them
at a star price of 99p and just let people bid on them and decide what they thought were worth
and I thought if I get 15, 10 or 15 quid for each one I'd be really happy and it got to the end of
the seven days of the auction and some of them were going up to 30, some 40 and I had 10 of these
up and by the end of the auctions they all ended on the same day and I made something like 300 quid
and I thought that's exactly what I need, I couldn't believe it to be honest, I was
surprised but absolutely elated of course and I was carrying on by the time it got to the end
of January, obviously that's 31 paintings I've done and each one of those are all sold
so I was starting to put them on daily auctions so every day there was an option and it would finish
on seven days time and they were all selling. By the middle of February I was earning the same
amount that I was earning at my full-time job so I spoke to my employers and I thought and I
asked them and I said is it okay if I just hammer notice it, give two weeks and can I just go and
they gave me their blessing and said of course so I worked out my two weeks at the job and by the
end of February I left my job when I found myself in the position of being a full-time painter which
was a dream come true and I was still selling, I was still painting the painting a day and by the
end of March I had driven my van down to the south of France and I was selling paintings from
the back of my van on the beach in the south of France to people in the UK so that was how I began
and that I mean to bring it back to the mental health thing I took myself from quite a depressed
state of thinking that I was literally, I thought I was going through a cross between a midlife
crisis and just needed an adventure and I put those two things together and mixed it all up
with some creativity and then created what essentially is my dream job and that's how I
began becoming a painter. Since then I travelled thousands and thousands of miles in my van,
I went from place to place, all I needed was the internet so that I could put paintings online
and I could have my PayPal account set up, I could put the auctions on eBay, I could post work up,
I could write the blog about what I was doing and I would get the money and all of the painting
sold some for a little, there were a fair few that did just go for the 99p but some went for 60 to 80
could so it all balanced out. That lasted for a long time, it was six, seven, nearly eight years
that I was doing that consistently. I was travelling in various places, I was going to Cornwall,
I was going through Devon and all along the south coast. I spent four months in France
which was just an incredible experience, it was beautiful.
Do you speak French?
I speak parmard, I don't speak brilliant French but I speak okay French and I can get by.
It's quite strange when you're in France or when I was there, I took the basic French that I knew
and suddenly found myself getting better literally by every few days I was finding myself getting
better. I think if I'd have stayed for six months or a year I'd have got pretty fluent at it but
yeah when you're immersed in it and the only thing you can do is speak and listen to French then
you do get, you start to survive a bit better each day. So yeah it's not too bad, it's got rusty again.
But everything was great up until we hit the pandemic. So we got to the pandemic back in 2019,
2020. Yeah, into 2019. Yeah so the pandemic that hit in 2019 and I was lucky that I had a place to
park my van which was on a farm in Dorset in a place called Perbec. I'd been staying at Perbec
a lot. I was using it as a base because it's a stunningly beautiful place on the south coast.
It's got the place called the Jurassic Coast which stretches from Pool Harbor all the way
along through down into Devon and all of that is just stunning, beautiful stretch of coastline.
So the pandemic, I found myself grounded. I couldn't go out, I couldn't visit places, I couldn't go
and into favorite locations and paints. I was stuck in one place. I was very lucky to have the
place and the farm that I was staying at and I had the top floor of the other barn to use the studio.
So still working but as it goes, as things happen, I did get involved with a lady and it was when
there was gaps in the pandemic, we had a gap in it before it went back into lockdown again and we got
together and I ended up moving in with her but we got on so well. It was brilliant. We then moved
down there and we moved to Glastonbury together and we both had vans at that point. So we had his
and hers camper vans which was brilliant. So we moved to these allotments in Glastonbury,
beautiful place again. We were so lucky to have that. They were happy to have us there because we
were kind of like guardians, a little bit of security kind of thing. Talking of mental health,
the allotments were for people with either mental health issues or special needs and so they could
get a day or two days in there to do gardening which is incredibly therapeutic, kind of like a
self-help area where people could get together and just do gardening. It was beautiful. So my girlfriend
and I stayed there for a while and then I had a bit of a disaster. We went to see her parents up in
Swindon. I drove my van up there. When we were driving back, it was late at night, it was raining,
we were going around a corner. I was totally under the speed limit but there was a bit of an idiot
parked on the other side of the road and someone in a land rover with a trailer on the back
came up behind that car, went to overtake it and didn't really see me coming. So I ended up slamming
the brakes on, didn't stand a chance and slammed head on into the trailer at the back of this
land rover and flipped the trailer over, completely smashed the front of my van in and it was a total
rise off. That was devastating. I feel extremely lucky that neither myself and my girlfriend got
any serious damage, ourselves or injuries but my van was completely written off. It was totaled.
Bear in mind, it was my pride and joy anyway but the history behind that vehicle was more than just
a ban to me. It had been my home for years, it had been the beginning of a project. Yeah, I did
lose it quite badly after that. I was very good on the outside, I kept it together on the outside but
on the inside I started to go downhill quite quickly. The insurance payout was terrible,
they would go all out to give you the best insurance possible when you go to claim and
it's just ridiculous. I got about two-thirds of what my van was worth. Because it was in the
pandemic I went in to buy another van, another VW camper van but van prices have gone absolutely
through the roof at that point. I just really didn't know what to do. I was really depressed
at that point. That had a lot of strain on the relationship. I just wanted to be alone and I
just wanted to disappear somewhere. So I did and I had to break up for my sanity. I decided to just
leave and I landed on my feet a little. I was lucky that some friends in Dorset, they were
renting out an old converted coach on their land and I moved into that and I stayed in that coach.
It had a great big wood burner, had a cooker, big double bed at the back, really lovely people,
beautiful land and I stayed there over winter. It had a great time. I found myself getting back
into the swing of painting again. After the crash I practically stopped painting. I wasn't earning
much money. We got a bit of a payout from the government being self-employed. So that was
basically just what I lived on. I didn't have that spark of creativity. I felt I'd lost it.
But when I was in that coach I found that coming back again and I started painting a lot more.
Again, I was so lucky that my customers and people that were seeing the paintings
were still there and they still wanted to buy and I started making a bit of money again,
which was great. They rented that coach out under the provision that it was only until
I believe it was June the following year. So I did leave in June and I went and stayed at a friend's
house. Again, I was without a vehicle. I was a bit lost. I didn't know what I was doing.
Losing that camper van, that really was the crux of the downhill travel for me.
I spent a couple of months staying with my really lovely friend in Dorchester. It was just something
nagging away at me thinking I've got to do something. I've got to get out of this rut.
There was something in the back of my mind that is very strange when ideas manifest themselves.
You get inspiration from different places. You don't just have an idea and go,
I'm going to do that. You get a little bit of a fragment from here, a little bit of
an inspiration from there. Those things start coming together and then this idea forms and
manifests itself and literally just won't go away. That idea was to go and walk the
South Force coast path, which people know about it. It's become a lot more well known
in recent years, especially from the book, The Salt Path, which is going to come out as a film
next April as it goes. The South Force coast path is the longest continuous path in the UK,
which traditionally stretches from Minehead in North Somerset, goes all the way down the
coast of North Cornwall, around Land's End and all the way along the South Coast to Poole.
It's 630 miles in total. I just thought I really want to do that. I want to walk the South Force
coast path. My housemate that I was renting from, she goes, I've got a rucksack here you can use.
I went, thanks very much. I bought myself some boots. I got a few bits of camping equipment.
I bought a tent off of eBay and I basically just had nothing other than that. I thought,
I'm going to take painting gear, but how do I do this? Because I can't take easels and canvases and
whatever. I had a bit of a brainstorm with a friend of mine and he actually came up with the idea,
why don't you just take single sheets of canvas, get a roll of canvas, cut some single sheets out
of it and somehow paint on those. So I did devise this plan. What I essentially used is
just a flat piece of cardboard that I could spray glue the sheet of canvas to.
And I invented a drying box with, which was about two inches deep, which the canvas would sit in
and it would have a ridged lid on it so that the top of the box couldn't touch the canvas.
So I could carry wet oil paintings with me. So oil paintings take, well, depending on how thick you
lay the paint on, they can take months to dry, but they were presumably still taking quite a while
to dry while you were carrying them around. Firstly, I used a quick drying oil paint,
Griffin Alkyd. It's by Winsor & Newton. It's Griffin Alkyd oil paint. I swapped out some of the
slower drying colors for those. Some colors dry naturally quite quick, but some take a long time
like cadmium red, sap green, ivory black, cadmium yellow. Those colors can take quite a long time
to dry. But if you swap them out for Griffin Alkyd, then they dry literally within a day to two days.
I did a trial run, did one painting, I put it in the box, I left it. By the next day, it dried.
I also use a lot of titanium white and that tends to get mixed in with a lot of other things when
you're toning down with oil paintings. So I use Griffin Alkyd in the titanium white. So you're
actually adding a drying medium, a quick drying medium into the paints that are slow drying anyway.
So that sped up the drying process loads. So literally the first of September, I had my bag
packed. I got 60 sheets of canvas in a box. I packed my oil painting. I needed a jar of white
spirit with some spare white spirit. I needed brushes. I had all of that in the bottom of my
rucksack. And then all the other things I had, I just had the trousers I was wearing, three pairs
of socks, a t-shirt, a jacket, a tent, some cooking gear, and a sleeping bag, and a couple of other
bits and bobs like obviously a torch. And that was it. I believe I had 220 pounds in the bank.
That was all I had. I went to Lidl's and I got a bag of shopping and my housemate took me down to
Paul Harburn, gave me a hug and said, off you go. And I just trotted it off down the beach. I only
got 500 yards because it was in the evening. I only walked 500 yards and then pitched my tent
in the sand jeez, cooked up some food, watched the sun go down and went to sleep. And yeah, the next
morning I woke up very early, 5.30 as it was September the 2nd, and I thought I am now on
South West Coast path. So here we go. So you set off on this expedition with a tent, really on the
cusp of winter, right? September things are going to start to change. How long did you expect it to
take? It's supposed to take about two months if you do it daily, three months if you're not very
fit. So I thought September to the end of October, you know, going into November, it's not too bad.
I found out very, very quickly indeed that weight is a massive issue. However much weight you're
carrying is a big, big issue. I didn't realise, but essentially the ideal way for carrying
hiking gear is that I think it's about a third of your body weight is the maximum.
And I was carrying 22 kilos. So I'm not completely sure how much away, but 22 kilos is a lot for
anybody. And I realised very quickly because I was walking on the beach, which is actually the most
difficult terrain to walk along the beach. I got to the first bin that I found along the beach,
and I started decanting things out of my bag and certain food items that I thought I'm not going
to eat this within the next three or four days. And I just need to get with as much weight as possible.
Yeah, that first day of walking that path, I hit the first hill, which goes up to Old Harry Rocks.
And, you know, I had a walking pole with me and I'm glad I did. Trying to get up that very first
hill with that backpack on, I then realised that I was very unfit. I wasn't fit at all.
Every hundred yards I was stopping and wheezing and out of breath. But I got to the top of the
hill and I got to Old Harry Rocks, which is the first landmark. I think that was seven and a half
miles I managed on the first day. And I was absolutely shattered. I managed to find a little
place to pitch my tent just above the beach. Spent the night there. And the next morning I woke up.
It was early. I got the sunrise and I thought, I'm going to do a painting. Let's get this underway.
And I got the painting gear out and I painted the first painting. And it was just basically a
sunrise with the beach. Next day carried on. And every day just did a painting. I couldn't believe
it because within a few days I'd walked 40 miles along that coast and I felt myself starting to get
a bit fitter. And amazingly, and this is the most important thing, is I felt a massive amount of
relief. All the stress and the pressure and the things that had happened previously had just been
lifted off me like a weight. It's a bit of a cliche, but I felt alive. I felt enthusiastic
about what I was doing. Sitting in a field overlooking the sea and just watching the
butterflies, just having a rest, drinking water. It's the simplest thing in the world. But I felt
so happy knowing that I was doing the paintings and I had all of this experience to look forward to.
Yet again, I started posting these paintings online. I started taking video blogs with myself,
videoing where I was, showing people the locations. And that started to become really popular. I was
getting a lot of hits, a lot of Facebook views. Soon enough people started asking how much of
the paintings are these for sale. So instead of eBaying them, I just put a message out saying,
here's all the paintings I've done so far. I've done 10 at that point. I said, here they all are.
Here's how many miles they are of the path so far. Here's the locations. And I just put them
all up for sale at £80 each. And I said, instead of paying the £80, you can pay £50 as a reserve
to reserve the painting and then hold £30 back. And then if you allow me to keep hold of the
paintings, then when I finish the walk, I'll frame it, exhibit all of them as a show, and then I'll
post it to you. And very kindly, everyone that offered to buy the paintings said, but that's
fine, keep hold of them. So I suddenly found myself getting painting sales at £50 each,
just for doing a walk and painting and painting each day. And I started to get into the routine
of painting, paintings every day, or as near to every day as I could. And then on a Sunday,
I'd have a rest and go into an establishment like a pub or a cafe, I'd go online, put all the
paintings up, list them, say what was for sale. And then I'd suddenly within an hour, I'd have sold
either most of them or one of them. And they all sold. I was in heaven. And it got through to
November. That was in 2021. And that was when the massive storms hit. And I did battle through the
storms. And I didn't do very well with it. I was on the cliff tops, it was getting really dangerous.
I had a couple of smashed tent nights where my tent just got absolutely demolished. And then on
the third time that that happened, it was I was scared, because I was absolutely soaking wet,
it was getting close to zero degrees. And I thought this, I think I've come to the end of this
chapter. So I took a break. And I went back, I was lucky to go back to the coach for that winter
again, in Dorchester. And as soon as it got to July the next year, I got back on the path from
where I finished, and then began again. So that was St Ives, I'd got as far as St Ives, which was
415 miles in the first leg. So yeah, I actually spent four months on the second leg of just going
from St Ives all the way up to my head. Because I found myself loving it so much that I didn't want
it to end. So whenever I got to certain locations, that I felt comfortable that I was out of the way
that I could pitch my tent and nobody knew. And there was enough supplies nearby like a shop,
in some way that I could get online easily. I might stay there for three or four days, even a week
at a time. Again, doing the paintings, absolutely loving it. They were all selling. I finished the
walk on the 22nd of October 2022. I went back to Dorchester, I arranged to have an exhibition of
all the paintings that I'd sold and created. And I was very lucky to get a spot. Ironically,
at Dalston Castle, which was the very first place that I stayed in when I began the walk.
So they offered me what's called the Belvedere Suite on the top floor, which had 360 degree
panoramic of the area of the coast. I hosted an exhibition there and I painted by that time,
it's 147 paintings of which documented the entire San Francisco's path from my perspective.
I lined them up along the wall so that they're in chronological order. Loads of people came.
The comments were fantastic. Everybody seemed to really enjoy the show. It's incredibly humbling.
And that was the culmination of a project that had taken me approximately two years.
So I've never had an exhibition before. I put paintings in a pub, but I'd never had a proper
solo exhibition. So for me, that really hit the nail on the head for my personal humble achievement
that I set out to do. That I'd extend from having these mental health issues of depression,
not knowing what to do with myself, suffering loss, going through that and thinking about
creativity. That's how I get through. I need to be creative. I need to be doing something that is
crazy. And if I'm not, I know that I will start to go back down that slope again. So it's a huge
thing for me and it's something that's set in stone for life for me now. I'll always be painting.
I'll always be making music. And I have to keep remembering that if I do stop doing it,
the ladder is presented in front of me and I can either go down it or I can stop creating again.
So it's a fantastic kind of like benchmark to know if you start feeling a bit
dawdy with yourself, then stop what you're doing and go and paint the picture.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's the same for me. My studio is my refuge and I have to be painting.
And when I'm not, I just descend really quickly. So I fully get that. So you've since done a trip
around summer Scotland. I have. Yeah. Again, when I finished the walk, I started to, I finished the
exhibition and I did that. I found myself in the same place again. I was like, what we're going to
do now? I'm a bit lost now. But I gathered myself up and I thought as soon as the weather starts to
get a bit warmer, I'm going to hit Scotland and I'm going to hike through. I'm going to paint the
highlights. That's been a dream that I'd wanted to do for a long time as well. So that coincided
with the incredibly generous offer from my lovely friends that said, if you want keys to this house,
you can do it. And I thought, that's close to Scotland. So I jumped at the chance of accepting
the key and moved up here to this lovely, lovely property. They say that I'm doing them a favor by
looking after it. And essentially I've just commentated it into a painting studio. They
absolutely love because they've had loads of paintings of me. I hiked through Scotland. I spent
two and a half months. I didn't paint as many paintings as went on the coast path. I did.
I think it was about 28. But again, most of those sold. Very, very different of the coast path
because of one, the weather. It would rain for two or three days in the trot. It's a lot colder at
times and then suddenly it's making hot. So it's very difficult to plan. Internet reception
has a lot to be decided. So there's quite a few factors that did stand in my way. Again,
I plan to do it. I did it. Loved it. I'm planning to go back to do the Hebridean way
when it gets warm again. But that's next year. Because I do look back and when you're thinking,
have I really done anything? Have I achieved anything? Yes, painting paintings is a lovely
thing to do. The humbleness again, I had to keep going back to that. Because when people do say
that they love what you're doing. And they say, I gave that to my family member as a gift and
they absolutely love it. That's a special place that you painted. And they've now got a permanent
reminder of it from you. That's amazing. It's an amazing feeling. That makes you feel so good.
I kept a pretty good catalogue over time. And I think it's total, it's just over 2,200
that I've painted and I've sold. So that's just over 11 years. Those aren't going anywhere.
They'll continue to be there forever. So that's something that is amazing to think about. That's
kind of like the legacy of where I've travelled to, where I've been. Because all of these paintings
literally just document where I've travelled. And my personal perspective of how amazing the world
is and how amazing the coastline is. Special little things like a robin coming and sitting on a twig
next to you. Thank you robin. You know, immortalising. Yeah, well it's an amazing travelogue, right?
I mean, who can say they've done something like that and 2,000 paintings.
Well, yeah, I'm pretty prolific, but I don't think I'm anything close to that.
But so that's actually incredible. Your paintings themselves,
are they all 12 by 12 inch? Is that right? No, they vary wildly. The ones I did on the coast path,
they were all eight inch by eight inch. And they were single pieces of canvas, which I then mounted
and framed. And the frames themselves went to 12 inch by 12 inch. So they were floating frames.
And just to note, I found that the frames were so expensive to buy. If I wanted 140 frames,
that's a lot of money. I've been to the thousands of pounds. So I actually, I was kind of forced and
coerced by friends to go down the route of buying the frame material myself, buying all the hard
boards, buying all the mounting card. And then I spent a week making all the frames in a garage.
So I had to cut 147 times four, whatever that is, 600 of the edges. I had to cut those with
40, 90 degree angles, super glue all of those angles together, and then cut out 147 squares out of
147 pieces of card. So that's a lot harder than I think most people think. Just getting a clean 45
degree angle out of a piece of wood is actually, you've got to have a decent mitre saw or whatever.
And you're like a fragment out, like, and it's not going to go together ever. Right. And I've
tried this before and I've wasted so much wood. Luckily not like expensive framing wood, but like
I've wasted so much wood getting this wrong. And I just gave up. I've got this guy who sort of helps
me out with woodwork stuff. He just laughs at me. I'll just take it around his house now and say,
Mike, can you saw this for me? Because I ain't doing it. Yeah, I worked on that for, I was getting
up at seven in the morning. I was starting work at eight and I was finishing well into the nighttime.
So nine, 10 o'clock at night. And I did that for about a week because I only found out that I had
the exhibition a week before I had it. So I then realized that I had to get all of this work framed
within a week and I finished framing them the day before the exhibition. That's how close it was.
But yeah, that was 10 hour days. Amazing. Yeah, the music. So I spotted an Instagram video
of you playing a song about a seal. Did you write that? I think you wrote that, right?
Oh yeah. Yeah. I wrote that for a friend of mine that I've seen for a while. She used to go surfing
and there's a seal that always used to visit her when she was surfing. So I'll write her a song.
I went swimming in the sea, Brave Old Me in Scotland in a place called Montrose,
a bit sort of northeast coast. I had a wetsuit on. I'm not that stupid. And then the seal just
popped up and was just staring at me. It was really weird. And then in the background,
there was all these dolphins, like probably about a mile away, but you could see these dolphins
cavorting in the ocean. It was quite simply one of the most magical moments of my life. I was like,
this stuff doesn't happen, but it's all here folks in Scotland.
Blimey, yeah. I mean, just to go back to music, I grew up on making music. It's a very,
very strong passion of mine. I did the rock and roll thing. I stood on stage and rocked out with
a really cool band for four or five years. But when I moved to London, the making music for films,
that was wonderful. It's something that I really want to get back into at some point. I have done
some now and again, but that's, we played some amazing venues. Again, we did the VNA. I played
at Tate Modern, the British Museum, really quirky venues like museums, libraries and stuff, the
British library we played. The cabinet was living cinema. The guy that founded that was living in
London. He used to be the violin player or the viola player in an old band that I was playing
with, but he left and moved to London. So when I moved to London, he got in touch with me and said,
you moved to London. Do you want to get involved with this new project that started up, which was
main, re-scoring the music for films and playing it live. So I began that with him. And that grew
very quickly. That was a really cool project. And it ended up with, we'd have anything up to 20
musicians on the books that we could bring in to do various instruments for various films.
Yes, the band in London, that was amazing. But again, I mean, just to reiterate from the reasons
that I left London and essentially left the music scene at that time was I just could not handle
living in an area which didn't have the nature, so to speak. I really needed that. I needed adventure
and I needed to be in nature. So yeah, that's what I did. I love music. I love painting. That's
my creative outlets. I need to do that in order to keep my head in check. I feel incredibly lucky
that I'm able to go practically anywhere, paint and essentially make a living from it.
That's a rare thing in this day and age. And it's something I've really worked towards. I've worked
very, very hard at. But it seems that the universe has kind of like shined on me a little bit. And
I've had an incredibly wonderful and generous customer base that have really stopped buying it.
So, you know, that's, I can only look forward to the future and keep going with what's going on.
Yeah, and keep an eye on the weather by the sounds of it. Living in Scotland myself, I can appreciate
how challenging that must have been. And, you know, I'm no doubt when you come back again,
the weather's going to be all sorts of interesting for you. Maybe I'll try and zip up and meet you on
there on the trail at some point. So where can people find you on the internet?
The best thing is I've got my Facebook painting page set up. So that's Rob Parkinson painting.
I've also got an Etsy shop where I sell sign limited edition prints of previous kind of best
selling most popular work. And it's got my entire South West Coast painting series on there,
as well as the ones from Scotland. And that is the painting nomad. So it's Etsy, the painting
nomad. Okay, well, thank you for coming on onto my podcast. It's been an absolute pleasure.
And I wish you luck on your travels next year. Yeah, thank you very much for having me on.
It's been a pleasure to meet and to share a bit of my experience. Thank you.
