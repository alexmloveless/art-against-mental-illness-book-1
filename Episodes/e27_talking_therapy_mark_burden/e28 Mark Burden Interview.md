Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. I'm here with Mark Burden, an old friend of mine.
I think we've known each other for I think about five years. We met when we were both a member of
an art group in Windsor in the UK called the Windsor Art Collective, formerly known as the
Buttisit Art group. Me and Mark Bond did on a love of sort of technology in the Crosso with Art,
a reverence for Alan Turing and a general fetish for square artworks.
And so we've kept in touch. I've since moved out to Scotland. Mark's still in Windsor.
And so I'm just going to hand over to Mark to introduce himself. And yeah, Mark, tell us about
just a bit about yourself. Yeah, well, first of all, thank you very much, Alex, for inviting me to your
art and creativity for mental health podcast. You know, it's a pleasure to be here. And I just love
what you're doing. You know, to introduce myself, being a creative within an ecosystem, you know,
whether it's corporate or whether it's within the art world, and whether it's just in our personal
life is really important. And I think creativity gives us a lot. And we give a lot to our creative
processes. And so it's a question of, you know, what do artists do? I do consider myself an artist.
I've been an artist for many years. And thinking back to the initial inspiration, it was it was
stuff I did with my mum before I went to school, you know, it's kind of like drawing in a little
a four pad and just making kids drawings. And it's kind of like being a habit and practice that I've
stuck with more or less ever since. And I've gone to formal art education, you know, both in the past
when I was a kind of like late teenager. And just recently, in the last last few years, and, you know,
part of my life journey has been around mental health, well being. And part of my life journey
has been around mathematics and logic. And part of my life journey has been around this, this art
practice that I have. And being very interested in the connections and interconnections between
art, technology, and your mental and imaginative space. Amazing. And so I noted from one of your
bios that you have an MA in art and science. MA in art and science, you know, I did a practice
graduate course for two years, it was a part time course, I was working full time within an IT role,
which is essentially new service technology development. So it's kind of like leading edge,
leading edge stuff on the technology side, but trying to make sure that it interacts
well with people and their life and gives them value. And at the same time, I was very interested,
and really, this is a story since the COVID lockdown, where you're kind of like forced to
look at your life and think about what you're doing. And very interested in this kind of like
tech, art, science, interrelationship, because that's kind of where my life was at in terms of
my life journey. And figuring out that there were courses out there on the art side,
that kind of like look to that cross section into intersection of art and science. And so I applied
to do an MA, just a fine art MA at Central St. Martin's. So I did two years studying
on science and doing my own thing. So it was great. I mean, from my perspective, that's
incredible. I've had many abortive attempts at getting a degree. And sort of the intersection
of the two sides of my world are very like yours. It's on one side, science and technology and maths
and logic. On the other side, it's art and creativity. And I think we approach combining
those things in a very different way. Not always, there is definitely some overlap,
but do you want to tell us how that manifests in your art?
Yeah, I mean, I think I do two things. One is I'm very intuitive. So I try not to think before I do
anything. And I don't tend to have an interest or an end destination as I start out. I have a kind
of like a set of ingredients in my cookbook, visual or mental motifs that I want to play with.
And they have a particular meaning to me as well as maybe resonate with other people.
I realize, Mark, that we haven't even covered what your art actually is. So let's just rewind a bit,
because, you know, you've got quite a unique thing, approach for your art. Can you just describe that?
Yeah, let me let me just say a few words about my artistic practice, because my artistic practice
these days is really about what I consider a number of themes. One is the everyday. The other
is a kind of like maths and science element. And then the other part, so kind of like machines,
surveillance, technology, and the other is poetry. So I kind of mash them all up together
to create work. And in terms of how I do that, I might use traditional means. So I could use
drawing or collage or, you know, painted elements. But most of the time I'm using applications,
you know, art applications on my iPad to to make images. And sometimes those images stay
as digital images. And sometimes they stay as little clips, you know, little video clips. And
sometimes they develop into prints or portfolios of prints or boxes of prints, or performance of
boxes of prints or or longer videos, kind of like assemblages of clips, reels and static images,
you know, which are shown on a video screen. So that's a lot about the kind of the media I'm using.
Typically, my work is small to, I would say medium size. So for me, large size would be
something like three foot by three foot. And it kind of like ranges in size. I'm quite interested
in the way things move from micro to macro and scale up. I really like my work large. So if I
was doing projected work and projected images, they could be the size of a house. And, you know,
there are particular thematics and annex you touched on some of those. You know, one is an
interest in Turing's work. Another is an interest in and Dante's poetry. And then I've got an
interest. I've been kind of obsessed with over the course of the last 12 1218 months, which is
related to Turing's and imitation game and intelligence tests for machines that relates
to AI and how we as humans are developing alien intelligence. And so, you know, I've been
incredibly intrigued with that. At the same time, my practice is kind of is grounded in
my everyday and my everyday has been for the last four or five years, something that's related to
chronic fatigue syndrome, and also to do with just recently, you know, the diagnosis was changed to
burnout. So again, that gives me a kind of like a perspective of of life, which where where art
plays a particular role. So creating art may not be completely therapeutic, but does have therapeutic
aspects to both the the artistic encounter with the viewer, and also to the artist when they're
where when they're working. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more view of what my
art practice is like. When I ask most people, why do you do art? What do you do? And they go,
why do all painting? Oh, what would you paint? Oh, like landscapes or something, right? And, and
that's pretty good. I've got a good way of, you know, triangulating, it could still be quite a
broad array of stuff, but the arts is pretty simple, right? I know what you do. But I think
if people were listening to this after that description, which was a very, very detailed
and adequate description of what you do, I'm still not sure they would know, right? Because your art
is quite distinct. And I think the closest I can come is collage. But collage that spans multiple
mediums. And in the real world, in the digital world. And I think if you looked at your Instagram
account, you're in your digital work is very, very well suited to Instagram, because it's almost all
square. And so the tiled Instagram profile view always looks incredible. But if you looked at that,
you would very much conclude you're a digital artist. And I love the idea that it spills out
into every domain. And so how do you how do you sort of link all that together? I mean, how do you
see it in terms of, say, a series of artworks, when it when it spans perhaps physical media,
digital and things like installations, multimedia, that type of thing? Typically, because I'm working
in things I work in probably my work is probably project based. And therefore, there's an element
of sequence and series to the stuff that I do. And that that work can take different forms. And
it's really as simple as that. So probably the easiest example I can give is working through
Dante's Divine Comedy, which is, I was was attracted to it during COVID. Because I thought
although I can't travel physically, I can travel in a mental space. And I wonder what it would be
like if Dante was right, and all the modern scientists were wrong, you know, just like we
will end up in the circles of hell and purgatory and the celestial realms. So it was it was kind of
like an interested in cutting edge science, and philosophy of the media medieval times,
combined with Dante's love of numbers and structure and discipline, in terms of how he
was forming kind of squares, squares of poems, you know, so his whole cycle is based around 10 by 10,
or there's 100 canto's. And so you've got all of these squares. So I was kind of like interested
in the math side as much as the science side. But I needed to make sure I wasn't thinking about
the sequence in a way that wasn't giving me a fresh insight. And so I took took each poem.
So each of the 100 canto's, you know, little poem songs that Dante wrote, and just did a work based
around that canto, not knowing the whole cycle, although understanding that, you know, you kind
of like move, move from a dark place to a level of enlightenment. And the work came out of that. And
it took different forms. I mean, it took print form, it took book form, it took video form, it took
spoken word and image. And it was really a combination, as you say, Alex of collage elements
that, or you know, is photo collage, it's collage, and they could be completely disparate. So the
idea was to make as many disparate things fit into some kind of harmonious sequential whole. And,
you know, see what happened and go on that journey and let other people join that journey as well.
Incredible. And did other people join that journey?
I showed the image and spoken word stuff within a lockdown British artist book fair event in Bristol,
and someone got their hands on it. And he turned out to be a poet who was doing his own new modern
version of the Divine Comedy. And so I've been doing some work to go alongside some of his poems
as he's been going on that journey. And that's been a joy to be part of, you know, to work with
a living collaborator rather than someone who's unfortunately passed away like Dante had.
That's incredible. I love it. And in terms of the words that go with your images, because again,
if we sort of think about the Instagram, it's a very visual medium, and a lot of people won't
notice the words on a place like Instagram. But obviously, I've seen various of your books,
publications, your regular Christmas cards, which I'll come back to. And so the words seem to me
that they are quite important to your artworks. And do you want to elaborate on that a bit?
Yeah, I mean, the kind of the word thing I've just always been fascinated with. And
I'm also interested in just the sounds of words. So again, within my practice, the two most recent
sequences, one has been an AE sequence, which is all around the the Atrocity Exhibition,
which is a book written by JG Ballard, which he started in the 1960s. And he used a kind of like
a collage process, which Burroughs used as well, you know, in terms of just cutting up the text and
seeing where it went. And I was using a similar process to create images that were inspired by
the Atrocity Exhibition. I condensed that down to the AE sound. So AE, you know, is it a scream? Is
it a cry for help? Is it just a sound? And that created, you know, that that kind of work created
me the opportunity to investigate video image. And this is work that I did at Central St. Martin's
video image, static image, spoken word, and also text word, so printed word and image.
And performative aspects of that. So mixing it all up. And the word part for me is sometimes it's
very, very factual, so we can use words in a very factual way. So nonfiction, and sometimes it's
more of a cut up process where it may just be, you know, repetitions of words or more poetic
play on words. And somehow they resonate. So a title will resonate with an image,
and it can spin your mind into different areas. And I think the Dadaists were great at using
words to destabilize the image that we were seeing to a certain extent, you may appear normal,
then you look at the title, and you wonder what's going on. And it creates different mental space.
So it creates a kind of like psychic resonance that takes you to different mental space than you
would do in terms of your normal encounter with the everyday. And I think that's what I'm looking
for. I just love that. There's a few things that spring to mind with what you just said. One of them
is Brian Eno and his cut up technique with artists like Bowie, I think Radiohead also did similar
things. And then for the what was the last thing you said? It's gone from my mind. What was the
last thing you just said? God, this is good, like ADHD to the max today. Anyway, yeah, oh no, it was
the note was the taking you to different mental space. So it was the oak tree. Can't remember
the artist. Have you come across the oak tree before? No, it might still be in the Tate Modern,
but I guess it could be anywhere is literally a glass of water on a on a glass shelf set about
six foot off the ground or something. And there's a piece of text that goes with it about why this
glass of water is an oak tree, which deals directly with the themes that you've been discussing there.
And it sort of goes to the very core of the thesis of modern art, especially since the
Dadais. But I don't think they were quite the first to it, but they were the first to call
out explicitly. And I just love that side of things. And, you know, I'm sort of getting more
more into abstract. So that's sort of becoming a bit more of a theme for me. So I really think
that's all absolutely fascinating. And I could talk about it all day. Just want to come back to
your experience going back to uni quite late in life. You know, obviously, you'd been doing art
for quite a long time before that you had a career and so on. And so how did you find that experience?
Did you how do you think it sort of changed you to develop you as an artist? And sort of why,
you know, given that you did it quite late in life, but what was the motivation there?
Were you were you is it was a mature course? Were you mixed with younger folks?
So no, I mean, it's interesting, probably in terms of the breakdown, you know, there were
probably about 10% who were old, older, more mature students, you know, so when I say old,
I mean, like, fifties plus, then, of course, you had a wide range, because it's an MA,
you weren't having you're having people in their 20s. But mainly, I would say the group,
a group of people would be in their 20s and 30s. So everyone was coming to the programming in quite
a mature way. So there were probably more women. In fact, there were more women than men on the
courses you'd find in mainly mainstream art education in the UK. You know, everyone was
coming from a different background. So you had people that were not practicing artists originally,
but had an interest in art, and we're wanting to develop a visual communication to, you know,
some of the stuff that they were doing in the past, you know, whether it was from a more purely
scientific background, or whether it was scientific administration or anything like that. So a wide
range of different career paths for people that were mainly in the 20s to 40s.
And so how do you think that affected your art practice?
I think it just why widen it up when you're exposed to different things. I mean, you know,
the rule of thumb that I took was, I don't want to do what I've done before,
an art school yet again, you know, so it wasn't a question of thinking, well, I've done this,
and I'll do a bit more of it. It was just like being open to the experience of doing something
different, and seeing what that different turned out to be. So my rule of thumb was,
if I've done something like this before, you know, I should cross it off my list of things to do now.
That was part and parcel of it. The second part was, as I started the course, I was diagnosed with
chronic fatigue. So I thought, you know, can I do a full time job and do this at the same time? And
the answer was probably, you know, the simple and logical answer was probably be no, but I carried
on doing it because I wanted to do it. Then I had COVID in the first year that was there, in the
March term, spring term, and that just completely whacked me out. So I had post COVID symptoms,
and only thing that I was planning to do just got put on the back burner. And it forced me to think
about stuff in a different way. You know, when you've got COVID, and when you've got chronic
fatigue, you can't really think about art in the same way, you know, your brain is not really able
to process that much. And so you have to kind of like concentrate on getting from the bed to the
sofa and then back again and having enough nutrition in the day. But when I was doing that,
I couldn't watch TV, couldn't read a book, but what I could do was just look out the window and
draw what was in front of me. And that's what I ended up doing, you know, so I had a whole series of
surveillance images that weren't ready to do with art school, but were ready to do with what my
everyday life was was like at the time, just looking out the window and probably that was
that was about it. And I developed that by looking at, you know, bits of my everyday life
under a microscope and doing micro, you know, drawings of what I could see under the microscope
as well. So it's just just really exploring what my everyday was. But you're looking at that from
an academic perspective as well. So having to think about writing a thesis writing an essay,
which was a topic of choice. And my topic of choice was really the intelligence of machines
through Alan Turing's work, and also through Marcel Duchamp's Dadaist work, you know,
the large glass, which is an image, a strange image on glass, which shows intelligent machines
communicating with each other and having emotions between each other as well, the male and female
female machines. So there was there was a lot of stuff going on. And I think you just mix things up
and go to places that you wouldn't go otherwise, because you're talking to people and meeting
people and seeing different things from what you would do normally. But on the other side,
a lot of the stuff was really grounded in my everyday. And the atrocity exhibition in Spard
work was really just as much about me watching TV images, you know, TV images about JFK and
doing some research on some of that stuff, the visual kind of like overstimulation of what we
see on TV. Crazy. It really, really is interesting. And I remember a lot of your, you know, your black
and white digital images, just bits of stuff you've seen outside the window and stuff. And
honestly, that was my favorite of your stuff ever. I absolutely loved it. And just this idea of the
sort of the haunting mundanity, you know, liminal spaces and just the, you know, suburban life
in a surveillance culture and all these things. And you can read so much into them. And you can
take them however you want. But I found them really haunting. I did, but like in a sort of
beautiful way. And I think, you know, I think they're incredible. And they look great in a big grid.
Yeah, they do look really great. I mean, and again, those images probably haven't been seen
that much. You know, so a lot of the work I do doesn't really get seen as much as I like it to.
And I like the idea of big grids. I'm thinking about how to do those kind of installations
online in a virtual space, because sometimes it's difficult to get the physical space,
but you can still get an impression. And you can still use that to, you know, manifest a physical
space to put the stuff in. And so the black and white were the observational work, you know,
I would call that as a surveillance theme. And, you know, sometimes that's inside the house,
or inside an environment. And sometimes it's just walking around and seeing what
what happens. So that's kind of part of my practice, you know, observing what's around
in the everyday, and thinking about the stuff that people don't typically post as stuff of
worthy on Instagram. So there's a level of banality about it, you know, it's the everyday banal.
Yeah, and that's such juxtaposed to all the selfies in front of the Taj Mahal, or whatever
people are doing, which which gets, you know, that's what's become mundane. And what's
interesting is the stuff that people don't spend any time looking at. And I am and so your your
grids of squares, you know, were huge influence on me. I was just mesmerized by the uniformity of
it, but the stories you could tell with with sort of slightly anonymous, you know, individual
pictures that stand alone tell one story that put together tell a completely different story.
And, and so I, you know, I started, as you've seen, doing a whole bunch of square artworks myself
at varying sizes, I did manage to make a physical grid. Yeah, I literally built it. Yeah, I built
it out because if I tried, yeah, if I try to hang them, like I just couldn't get them to,
even on hanging wires, I couldn't get them to hang in a sort of in a nicely geometric,
well spaced way. So I built a couple of frames and managed to get them up on the wall in the
exhibition I did in the in the cinema next door to me. That was that was actually an impartor homage
to you, Mark. So there you go. Well, thank you very, very much. I was altered to the work of Mark
Burden. Well, I mean, it was just a wonderful grid. And I just love seeing it, Alex. And I thought,
you know, independent of my influence or lack of influence on your work, I mean,
it was just a super piece of work. And I think when we're looking at grids, and we could talk
about grids probably for a week, if we wanted to, you know, there's something that's this particular
to the human condition about grids, you know, as soon as you see a straight line, you know,
humans been around. And, you know, as soon as you see a grid, you also know humans been around and
what we see within our social media, what we're seeing within any kind of, you know, technology
media as a series of grids. And I think it's just part of our commonplace part of our contemporary
everyday, something that would not have been usual for anyone apart from folks living in the 21st
century. Yeah, don't get me started. Right. I've got grids now. I'm going for grids on my podcast.
So, so talking about our art reflecting each other's, we've both depicted Alan Turing.
I've, I've only done it once, but you have lots. But the funny thing about my depiction of Alan
Turing in a slightly meta and recursive way actually includes one of your pictures of Alan
Turing as part of the collage behind the portrait. We've both got, I think, a healthy reverence of
the, I guess, what would you call him, the godfather, grandfather of computing or the progenitor of
computing. And I think that, you know, it was obvious those those two things were going to be
combined with people like us. My Turing painting is housed on a wall of a couple of IT nerds in
Sydney, Australia, which I find quite an amusing concept. What are your thoughts on Alan Turing?
He turns up in your work basically everywhere. He's kind of in, you know, even if he's not
appearing directly, he's in the background. And probably if I'd have known about Alan Turing when
I was at high school, I would have focused more on mathematics than art, you know, that's how powerful
Turing's influence is on me. And one of the things I was really fortunate to do, following and being
part of the Central St. Martin's in art and science was to get a collaboration with University
of Durham and the Bioscience Institute up there. And then they paired me up with a mathematician
called Andrew Krause, who's developed this wonderful app that's based around Turing's
mathematical model for morphogenesis. So the kind of like the things that we see in nature,
you know, we could see stripes on a zebra. And, you know, why do they morph in the way they do?
You could look at in zebrafish as well, you know, this little fish that kind of like dart around the
ocean. But, you know, this kind of like... Can I just stop you for a bit there? So morphogenesis, can you just elaborate on what that means?
For our less scientifically orientated listeners? I'm not able to understand the maths of Alan Turing.
So Alan Turing was really fascinated by why nature is like it is. And he thought there was
a mathematical principle underneath a lot of nature. And when you see the picture that his mum did,
his little drawing as mum did, when Alan Turing was at school, he was supposed to be in a hockey
match. And now you can see his mum drawing him looking and staring at the daisies. And he was
probably doing something like counting the petals or something daft like that. But he was absolutely
fascinated by this link to numbers in nature. And you can see it in the Fibonacci series. So the
Fibonacci series is where you get two numbers in the sequence. You start out all one and one.
You add them together to get two, and then you take two and the last number in the sequence one,
and then it equals three. So Alan Turing was always fascinated by Fibonacci in this number series that,
you know, when you look at it, it's one, one, two, three, five, eight, 13, 21, and so on.
And it's the same theorem that you can see in the golden section. You see it in Leonardo's work. You
see it in a lot of the Renaissance work where they figured out what one single point perspective was
and what this golden section was. And it's, you know, it's essentially the harmonics of our face,
is the harmonics of the natural world. So Turing was really interested in this. And he met up with
a lady that's in the imitation game film, Joan Clark, as she was at the time. You know, they had
discussions in their Bletchley Park breaks where they were cracking the code of the German enigma.
But they were talking about cracking the code of nature in terms of mathematical modeling.
And so, more for Genesis is a way of doing mathematical modeling to nature. And Turing
was first looking at something very, very simple. And so you've got things like Frisian cows,
you know, the cows with the black and white patches over them. And he spent an incredible
amount of time trying to figure out what the mathematical calculation and formula was
for why those cow shapes were kind of like randomized. So instead of just being spots,
they were kind of like abstract splurgy spots. And that really is my simple story around
what morphogenesis is. That is so cool. And I'm now not going to look at cows the same way again.
But I guess back to your original comment about zebra stripes. And so I'm assuming that all zebra
stripes are different, like a fingerprint and like the iris of the human eye and so on.
And of course, there's some mathematical grounding to that. But I think one of the things for me,
and my maths is okay, but good enough that I need to do my job. My mental arithmetic is non-existent.
And I see an obvious, clear and distinct overlap between art and maths. Maths is
fundamentally a creative endeavor, the moment you get into the more brutal edges of it. And I did
an episode which started off talking about Fermat's Last Theorem earlier this year. Yeah. And
for me, the really important mathematicians all say the same thing is that the right
proof for a mathematical problem is you know it's right because it's beautiful. It's elegant.
And I find, and it sort of reflects the idea that, yes, of course, nature is beautiful.
And mathematics is the language of nature, really. And so it should be beautiful too, right?
Yeah. No, I mean, a lot of the time, I think if you've got a mathematical bent,
you're looking for the formula underneath the surface. Why does something look like it does?
It's not because you can really appreciate the randomness and complexity on the surface. It's
because you can understand that there's a model underneath. And the model, as a great mathematician,
George Bloch said, every model is wrong, but some are useful. And so I think what we have with
mathematical theorems is something that are beautiful because it condense the complexity
of the world and the universe or an imaginative logical space into something that is understandable
and clear and simple. It's a wonderful thing. It's a wonderful thing. I couldn't agree more.
Right. So let's bring this one back to the here and now. So you've experienced a period of bow
now. I can empathize with that greatly. I think you're quite like me in that your brain is never
quiet. And so how do you feel that your art practice is helping your recovery? Hopefully
you're recovering from burnout. I think the art practice and again, you know, it's not about
results is about getting there and doing something. I've got my own way of gauging what I think is
interesting and what I'm curious about at a particular point in time. But the process of
making something in whatever media is a kind of way of articulating a response and a reaction to
something in life. And even the most abstractive artists will still be responding to something.
It's a reaction. Art is a reaction to something. And the art practice is the creation of something
that, you know, other people may call art, you know, they may call it good, bad or ugly art.
It doesn't really matter. But it's something that exists outside of our mental space. It's
got a physical reality, even if it's a performative piece that you still end up with a level of
documentation. So it's this kind of like this transition of taking stuff that you may have in
your head or, you know, there may be threads in your head that you're putting into a manifestation
in some form of media. And I think that whole process is very empowering, completely mesmerizing,
and, you know, full of surprises. And I think that's the kind of thing that is very life
affirming. It gives us a sense of control. It may be a very limited sphere of control,
but it gives us a sense of control, a sense of identity, a sense of purpose,
and a sense of curiosity, you know, what happens if I do this next? What happens if I did,
you know, green instead of red, or, you know, whatever, and it can be very, very simple,
or it can be, you know, highly complex, where you're dealing with what happens with, you know,
a particular idea, by place that idea in combination with another idea, what happens.
So I think all of that is just really, really important. And it means that, you know, your
mind and your body and your soul are engaged in something other than that the mundaneness and the
banality of of everyday life, and you're lifting it to a higher level. So for me, that is really
important in terms of being in some way in control of your own destiny, you know, and art is not a
process of is it a process for me of discovery and curiosity is not about an endpoint necessarily.
But that that I think is very life affirming. And I think it's really important to find those aspects
of creativity in our lives, because it gives us meaning and it gives us purpose. And for me, that's,
that's been a significant part of my recovery. And even if I'm looking at things like, you know,
magpies connecting stuff for their nests, you know, they'll pick up the most crazy things
to carry across from, you know, the roof to the tree where they're building their nest. And it
just shows that creativity is not just a human attribute, it exists within the plant and animal
kingdom as well. And it's something that we all need to find a way of tapping into to, to connect
to the the universe and something that's wider than ourselves. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. I
recorded a bunch of videos for my YouTube channel, and some of them are me walking around my local
woods just looking at stuff. I doubt anyone wants to watch this crap. But I'm like, Oh, look at this.
Oh, there's bird. There's like, you know, look at this tree. Isn't this tree awesome? And, and part
of the reason I do it is because I can get into my own head when I'm wandering around. Sometimes
I'll slap on a podcast or an audio book. Sometimes I'll listen to music and my brain wonders and,
and I've walked for a mile and I haven't noticed anything. And so what this does actually is forces
me to look and what I found actually, you know, sort of a valuable use of having these horrible
glowing rectangles we keep in our pockets is that actually, if I feel like I, you know,
want to share something, you know, it makes me more alert to what's around me. And, and, and I
might pull out and take a picture, but, but I've noticed it, you know what I mean? And that's really
important to me because I can miss stuff. My brain never shuts up. And, and, but I get really excited
and I find it really satisfying to sort of see and observe the world around me. And, and I think
art is a really good way of, of making me do that. And I really love the comments around control
because that resonates with me massively right now, because I lost a lot of control over my life,
you know, over the last year. And, and it really does feel like the artist, one thing I do have
control over. And that's why I think part of the reason I find it so calming and therapeutic. And,
and that's a, it's a really interesting aspect of it that I'm definitely going to drill more down on
in the coming weeks. The aspect of just being curious about our every day is something that
I was very, you know, still something I was part of my practice. So the every day is part of my
practice. And sometimes I would just go down the street and with my little screen, my mobile camera,
and it will just be a walk, I need to walk a hundred steps or 150 steps. And then I need to
look to the left and I'll take an image of what I find interesting. So instead of blanking it out,
I'll actually try and consciously within the space of time where you're not able to consciously
think about why you like it or why you don't and is it art or is it not art, it's just something
that you find of interest. And so you can kind of like do that walk looking at the sky, looking at
the ground, looking at left to right or whatever. And then you end up with this kind of like collage
and condensation of your walk. And your walk is a kind of like, it's a completely metaphysical
activity, which is completely unique to you, you're in your own body, but you're also in your own mind.
So you can be thinking about anything in anything in the world or anything out of this world,
at the same time as being placed in this physical location, which is completely specific, you know,
to this moving planet. And, you know, most of the time, we're not really conscious of what's going
on. We blank it out. Art and observation can be very interesting ways of trying to reconnect to
just what it's like being alive on this planet today. So here you have it, folks, the metaphysics
of walking to the shop to buy a pint of milk, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it's very zen,
and I love it. And I can again talk about this all day. I'm gonna start drawing this to a close,
though. And I really, really don't want to. So we'll do this again. So just coming up to this time
of the year, one of the regular fixtures of my Christmas is Christmas cards from you. I always
feel incredibly guilty. I stopped doing Christmas cards of any sort decades ago. And I have nowhere,
nothing like the discipline to be able to start, you know, making works of art to send to, you know,
friends and family at Christmas. But this is exactly what you do. And your Christmas cards,
for want of a better word, are many works of, well, they're just works of art. They're fabulous.
One thing that perhaps isn't clear about Mark's work, if you only see it digitally, is that when
you get a physical piece, it's beautiful, high quality products, high quality materials,
highly precisely assembled, and completely unique. So I'm not talking about, you know,
Santa and his reindeers, you know, depicted on the front of a bit of card from home, Mark.
We can show you, we could do a little, we could do a little, this is my 2024 Christmas art drop.
And so it's a combo of Mona Lisa with a little bit of abstraction in a way, in red and green.
That's really cool. And you get a lot of, you can see this Mona Lisa in the background.
So it's got a bit of dimension. Then you get a layer of this on the top, which shows the golden
section. So you can see that there's not just that. Then you get a bit of text on the back,
we won't be able to read. But this says Leonardo da Vinci used the mathematical Fibonacci pattern
to create the Mona Lisa. So when you're looking at the Mona Lisa, it's not just a painting of a
person is actually a mathematical construct as well. You've got Vasari saying in this work of
Leonardo, there was a smile so pleasing that it was a thing more divine than human to behold.
It was not other than alive. And then when you think about what we're doing at the moment,
you've got mathematical patterns, non organic forms of intelligence and use surveillance are
attributes of AI, so artificial intelligence. So therefore, is it logical to consider Mona Lisa to
be an early ancestor and precursor of artificial intelligence? So you get that? Oh my God.
And then you've got this piece of work is kind of like an assemblage. And it's got a little black
sheet of paper with my little stamp on. So you can see how the Fibonacci relates to Mona Lisa.
And then within the within the little package, which all fits into an A5 envelope, so it's all
cheap and cheerful. You get a certificate of authentication as well. Plus a little
God plus a little bit of Christmas message handwritten by me. And that's the only that's
the only part that I'm really doing. So you get my signature and any any little I mean,
there's a bit of Warhol there, I think. And always a pleasure. I mean, ultimately,
you have to make friends with Mark so that he'll send you one of his Christmas cards,
which I'm sure are going to be worth lots of money in the future. So I went to see the
the Mona Lisa at the Louvre. I'm sure you've done it yourself. And what struck me about it is I had
to queue up and then you sort of get to see it. And there's a bunch of like tourists in front of
it with cameras and camera phones and stuff. So most of your view of the Mona Lisa is obscured
by little electronic rectangles of people taking photos of it of themselves obscuring the Mona Lisa.
So it can't be properly seen in their photo. And it just struck me as being so very modern and
bizarre. And I really hate queues and I really hate crowds. So it was such a confusing and
a pilgrimage to something that was highly contemporary and not just the Mona Lisa.
Well, I think it was an artwork in itself. Right. I think that the scene was an artwork. And I don't
think anyone realized that they were part of this big piece of performance art. And it's so recursive,
especially when you get into the realms of, you know, Dan Brown and stuff like that. And as much
as all of that's made up nonsense, there is some facts and truth in that. And the Mona Lisa is a
piece of culture has accumulated so much extra, so many extra layers. And that's really interesting
about your own work, where it's got, you know, your Christmas card, where it's got the layers on top,
you've got a digital layer and a physical layer and then the whole golden ratio and things like
that. I just think Mona Lisa as a painting itself, I have no interest in. I have a lot of interest
in the culture that surrounds it right up to this very day. It's absolutely fascinating.
I guess we're drawing to a close and I think we could carry on talking for a lot longer, Alex.
I really, really will. It's always a delight to talk to you and to catch up. So thank you for
inviting me and. It's quite right. Can you tell us where to find you on the interwebs?
I've got a website which is www.markb.space. So that's my website. And if you're looking for my
Instagram, it's Markburden. That's M-A-R-K-B-U-R-D-E-N underscore art. So, you know, feel free to
follow me and feel free to drop into my website. What I'm planning to do in 2025 is to do some
virtual exhibitions on my website. So it has been lacking a little bit of TLC for the last couple
of years because I've just been too busy to do too much else. But you'll see some changes and you'll
see that I'll be making it much easier for people to buy work from me rather than making it quite
difficult at times. I'll just become friends of you and you'll send people your artwork for Christmas
for free. You should start charging. I'm going to auction it off.
You can see how much it goes for. But the work that I produce, I think, has got a very high value.
It may not have a high price at the moment, but it will do over time. I'm sure it will. So I'm
going to hold on to it for the moment as an investment in the future. Okay. Well, this has
been so, so interesting as ever. Every time we talk, Mark, it's always absolutely fascinating.
You say so many incredible things. So thanks for your time. Enjoy your Christmas. And we will
definitely talk again. Well, I mean, I'm just fascinated by your practice, Alex. I'm fascinated
by what you're doing with art and mental health. I think it's so vitally important. So I really
appreciate what you're doing. I really love the work you're doing. I think it just continues to
develop and evolve. And yeah, I'm looking forward to collaborating and meeting up in the new year
in some shape or form. And thank you very, very much for inviting me today.
Brilliant. Absolutely. Thank you very much. And we'll speak soon. Bye.
Bye bye.
