# Significant Passages and Quotes - Episode 27

## Core Philosophy of Art and Mental Health

> "You know, to introduce myself, being a creative within an ecosystem, you know, whether it's corporate or whether it's within the art world, and whether it's just in our personal life is really important. And I think creativity gives us a lot. And we give a lot to our creative processes." - Mark Burden

> "And being very interested in the connections and interconnections between art, technology, and your mental and imaginative space." - Mark Burden

## Creative Process and Approach

> "Yeah, I mean, I think I do two things. One is I'm very intuitive. So I try not to think before I do anything. And I don't tend to have an interest or an end destination as I start out. I have a kind of like a set of ingredients in my cookbook, visual or mental motifs that I want to play with." - Mark Burden

> "my artistic practice these days is really about what I consider a number of themes. One is the everyday. The other is a kind of like maths and science element. And then the other part, so kind of like machines, surveillance, technology, and the other is poetry. So I kind of mash them all up together to create work." - Mark Burden

## Art and Text Integration

> "the word part for me is sometimes it's very, very factual, so we can use words in a very factual way. So nonfiction, and sometimes it's more of a cut up process where it may just be, you know, repetitions of words or more poetic play on words. And somehow they resonate. So a title will resonate with an image, and it can spin your mind into different areas." - Mark Burden

> "And I think the Dadaists were great at using words to destabilize the image that we were seeing to a certain extent, you may appear normal, then you look at the title, and you wonder what's going on. And it creates different mental space. So it creates a kind of like psychic resonance that takes you to different mental space than you would do in terms of your normal encounter with the everyday." - Mark Burden

## University Experience and Growth

> "I don't want to do what I've done before, an art school yet again, you know, so it wasn't a question of thinking, well, I've done this, and I'll do a bit more of it. It was just like being open to the experience of doing something different, and seeing what that different turned out to be." - Mark Burden

> "when you've got COVID, and when you've got chronic fatigue, you can't really think about art in the same way, you know, your brain is not really able to process that much. And so you have to kind of like concentrate on getting from the bed to the sofa and then back again and having enough nutrition in the day. But when I was doing that, I couldn't watch TV, couldn't read a book, but what I could do was just look out the window and draw what was in front of me." - Mark Burden

## Mathematics and Nature

> "So Alan Turing was really fascinated by why nature is like it is. And he thought there was a mathematical principle underneath a lot of nature." - Mark Burden

> "And you can see it in the Fibonacci series... And it's the same theorem that you can see in the golden section. You see it in Leonardo's work. You see it in a lot of the Renaissance work where they figured out what one single point perspective was and what this golden section was. And it's, you know, it's essentially the harmonics of our face, is the harmonics of the natural world." - Mark Burden

> "a lot of the time, I think if you've got a mathematical bent, you're looking for the formula underneath the surface. Why does something look like it does? It's not because you can really appreciate the randomness and complexity on the surface. It's because you can understand that there's a model underneath." - Mark Burden

## Art as Recovery and Control

> "I think the art practice and again, you know, it's not about results is about getting there and doing something... But the process of making something in whatever media is a kind of way of articulating a response and a reaction to something in life. And even the most abstractive artists will still be responding to something. It's a reaction. Art is a reaction to something." - Mark Burden

> "And I think that whole process is very empowering, completely mesmerizing, and, you know, full of surprises. And I think that's the kind of thing that is very life affirming. It gives us a sense of control. It may be a very limited sphere of control, but it gives us a sense of control, a sense of identity, a sense of purpose, and a sense of curiosity, you know, what happens if I do this next?" - Mark Burden

> "your mind and your body and your soul are engaged in something other than that the mundaneness and the banality of everyday life, and you're lifting it to a higher level. So for me, that is really important in terms of being in some way in control of your own destiny" - Mark Burden

## Observation and Everyday Life

> "And sometimes I would just go down the street and with my little screen, my mobile camera, and it will just be a walk, I need to walk a hundred steps or 150 steps. And then I need to look to the left and I'll take an image of what I find interesting. So instead of blanking it out, I'll actually try and consciously within the space of time where you're not able to consciously think about why you like it or why you don't and is it art or is it not art, it's just something that you find of interest." - Mark Burden

> "And your walk is a kind of like, it's a completely metaphysical activity, which is completely unique to you, you're in your own body, but you're also in your own mind. So you can be thinking about anything in anything in the world or anything out of this world, at the same time as being placed in this physical location, which is completely specific, you know, to this moving planet." - Mark Burden

> "Art and observation can be very interesting ways of trying to reconnect to just what it's like being alive on this planet today." - Mark Burden

## Mathematical Beauty and Proof

> "for me, the really important mathematicians all say the same thing is that the right proof for a mathematical problem is you know it's right because it's beautiful. It's elegant. And I find, and it sort of reflects the idea that, yes, of course, nature is beautiful. And mathematics is the language of nature, really. And so it should be beautiful too, right?" - Alex

> "I think what we have with mathematical theorems is something that are beautiful because it condense the complexity of the world and the universe or an imaginative logical space into something that is understandable and clear and simple. It's a wonderful thing." - Mark Burden

## Creativity Beyond Humans

> "And even if I'm looking at things like, you know, magpies connecting stuff for their nests, you know, they'll pick up the most crazy things to carry across from, you know, the roof to the tree where they're building their nest. And it just shows that creativity is not just a human attribute, it exists within the plant and animal kingdom as well. And it's something that we all need to find a way of tapping into to, to connect to the the universe and something that's wider than ourselves." - Mark Burden

## Alex's Reflections

> "And I really love the comments around control because that resonates with me massively right now, because I lost a lot of control over my life, you know, over the last year. And, and it really does feel like the artist, one thing I do have control over. And that's why I think part of the reason I find it so calming and therapeutic." - Alex

> "And I've walked for a mile and I haven't noticed anything. And so what this does actually is forces me to look and what I found actually, you know, sort of a valuable use of having these horrible glowing rectangles we keep in our pockets is that actually, if I feel like I, you know, want to share something, you know, it makes me more alert to what's around me." - Alex

## On Collaboration and Mutual Influence

> "Well, I mean, it's interesting, probably in terms of the breakdown, you know, there were probably about 10% who were old, older, more mature students, you know, so when I say old, I mean, like, fifties plus, then, of course, you had a wide range, because it's an MA, you weren't having you're having people in their 20s. But mainly, I would say the group, a group of people would be in their 20s and 30s." - Mark Burden

> "That was that was actually an impartor homage to you, Mark. So there you go. Well, thank you very, very much. I was altered to the work of Mark Burden. Well, I mean, it was just a wonderful grid. And I just love seeing it, Alex." - Alex and Mark exchange
