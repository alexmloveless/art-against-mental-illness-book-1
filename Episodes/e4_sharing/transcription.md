Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. Art is a conversation. Even if your work has never been
seen by anyone but you, at its outset it's a conversation with yourself, with your subconscious.
Consider American 19th century poet Emily Dickinson. She had just 10 poems published in
her lifetime. She didn't like the way that the publisher had interfered with her poems before
they were published. She was a very unconventional poet you see. Some would say an innovator,
but the publisher thought that her work needed editing, like there was something wrong with it.
She didn't. She knew that they were perfect already and all this meddling changed their meaning,
which is a travesty in the world of poetry. So Emily simply stopped submitting them. She didn't
stop writing them though. Towards the end of her life Emily reportedly became a recluse,
rarely leaving her house or even her room. When she died at the age of 56 in 1886 her sister found
a stash of 1,800 poems in her room. Yep, 1,800. Many are considered classics and as a body of
work it's considered among poetry's greatest. My point is you don't need to share your work for it
to be worthy, for it to provide the transformative healing action that I bang on about here. Never
feel pressured to share your work. Never. What you make is yours and yours alone and if you want to
keep it to yourself that's what you should do. You're in beautiful amazing company. But, but,
the world is a better place for Emily's sister having discovered her secret stash. Her poetry
is truly beautiful, very dark in places, introspective and deeply personal. Some of it tragic,
some of it ecstatic. There's something in there for everyone and many many people find comfort
and solace in her work. I hope she would have approved of the rest of us being able to experience
it. Her works inspired everyone from Sylvia Plath to Taylor Swift. She had impact. The single biggest
influence on me, the person who inspired me to take up making art in the first place as a teen
and who continued to inspire and encourage me to push my creative boundaries for decades to come,
is one of my oldest and closest friends, although we've been a bit estranged of late.
That's another story that also relates to mental illness, for another day maybe. Anyway, I won't
name him here as I'm not sure he'll appreciate it. He's a very private person and has only ever
shown his work to a couple of people, let alone let it be seen by other randoms. He has literally
thousands of pages of incredible intricate comics. Think Marvel but so much darker and
older. A rich world of unique design and mesmerizing colour and totally original characters and
stories. There are huge piles of it around his house, piled up in corners, boxes of the stuff,
all on A4 photocopier paper. I doubt he'll ever let them be seen by anyone else. They're not
for other people, it's for him. And that's just fine. I feel privileged to have seen some of them
myself. He literally changed my life. And that's where the rubber hits the road here. Art changes
lives. Art inspires and motivates. Art heals and unites. The world needs art. I think that my friend
and the elusive Emily are outliers. Most people who set out to make art do want others to see it,
but are prevented through lack of confidence, fear of criticism or rejection, or maybe the
worry that their art doesn't matter, that no one will care. These are all valid concerns,
but they can and should be overcome. In this episode I'm going to try to illustrate to you
why you should overcome these objections. We will cover the how in coming episodes. In fact,
in many ways that's what this whole podcast is about. Now I'm not going to talk here about the
business of being an artist. I'm not going to talk about monetizing your work or promoting yourself
on Insta or anything like that. Maybe I'll cover that another time. I just want to talk about why
sharing your art matters, how it can help you connect to the world and how you can use those
connections for healing of yourself and those you connect with. Let's get on with it, shall we?
To help with that, I'm going to talk about autism. Yep, autism. You see, I'm autistic purely as an
aside. I have a suspicion that Emily Dickinson was too, but that's purely hopeful speculation on my
part. So anyway, you probably know a bit about autism. Maybe you are autistic and many creative
people are, in which case be patient. I'm not going to give the full exhaustive breakdown of
what autism is here, but we'll definitely come back to this subject again. But right now I want
to talk briefly about the autistic experience of interfacing with the world because I think it will
help explain why creating connections through art is so valuable. Dealing with humans is troublesome
for autistics. It's not that we can't carry out the interactions with other humans, but it's always
harder for us. It takes a lot more effort and it's fraught with missteps, dangers and trauma.
Think of it like being a five foot tall person playing basketball. The average height of an
NBA player is close to six foot four, which implies that many are much taller than that.
It turns out that height is a huge advantage in basketball, as you might imagine. The basketball
players that are technically the best are actually the shorter ones. The tall guys earn their keep
for sure and they still score the points, but the short players have to work much harder to even
compete, let alone score. They tend to be truly exceptional players, but they've got an
unconquerable disadvantage. This is what it's like being autistic every time we encounter other
humans. We have to work really hard to just keep up. Many times we just get stomped on. It's mentally
and emotionally exhausting, but we just have to do it. We don't have a lot of choice. We develop
all sorts of methods and coping mechanisms to account for our deficit. Anyway, one thing I and
many other autistics find exceptionally difficult is approaching people we don't know, just rocking
up to someone and kicking off a conversation. I'm terrible at small talk. It makes no sense to me.
It seems pointless. I have no idea what the other person is likely to say or how to respond.
I just want to get straight to the point, to dive right into a much more meaningful conversation.
But that tends to freak people out for some reason, so I get stuck in these strange,
unpredictable conversations, saturated in subtle social norms and steeped in subtext, and I
frequently end up saying something really odd, because I get nervous and confused and can't
follow what's going on, and people try to run away. So I avoid doing this at all costs. I literally
find it terrifying, so I'm not good at meeting people and making new connections. This leaves
me feeling isolated, anxious and ashamed. More little cuts to add to the thousands that are
already there. They all add up. One way I have of dealing with this is not healthy at all.
So alcohol gives you courage, right? For years, from way before I knew I was autistic,
I would drink alcohol at any social event. In fact, I frequently still do. I genuinely didn't know
that the reason that I was doing this was because the alcohol dampened my inhibitions and allowed
me to relax enough to hold an almost normal conversation. This is an all too common pattern
for autistics. Via this route, I had convinced myself that I was confident and outgoing.
But here's the thing. I was still rubbish at making those connections, just a slightly different
kind of rubbish. A louder, more obnoxious kind of rubbish. And I would sometimes make a fool of
myself and feel terrible in the morning, and wanted to hide away even more, thus increasing
the cycle of isolation and shame. More cuts. What I discovered when I started exhibiting my art
transformed my approach to this problem. Because when I show my art, three things happen. One,
people rock up and talk to me. Two, they tend to skip past the small talk. And three, we automatically
have something to talk about. My art. Now I know exactly how to talk about that. And my enthusiasm
for this subject tends to be infectious. Well, sidestep the fact that I'm terrible at converting
these conversations into sales. But who cares? I'm talking. At that point, people tell me all
sorts of things about themselves. Their life, stuff they love. And they tell me all about my art.
They often have all sorts of thoughts and opinions on it. They often observe things about my art that
I'd never thought about myself. When this first happened, when someone rocked up and told me lots
of things about what an artwork I had made meant, their interpretation wasn't at all what I had in
mind when I'd made that artwork. I was a little incredulous. I didn't say it at the time,
thankfully, but I thought to myself, no, that's not right. Stop misinterpreting my art. It felt
like a bit of a violation. But when I reflected on it after, I realized how mind blowing that was.
Someone had projected their own story, their own creativity, inspired by their own life and
experiences onto my artwork and made it mean something totally different. It was as if they'd
made a new artwork. And their version was actually better than mine. I realized at that point that
once you put an artwork out there, it's not yours anymore. It takes on a life of its own. And once
it takes up residence in someone else's house, in someone else's head, it develops a secret life that
you'll never be partied to. As a new owner, it evolves their story based on new stuff that they
noticed about the work, new experiences that they project onto it, conversations they have about it
with other people that gets integrated in their understanding of it. And those other people now
have their own interpretation, integrating their points of view into their own understanding of
the work. And this just keeps perpetuating as long as people are able to experience that artwork.
Imagine how many stories have been projected onto the Mona Lisa or Van Gogh's Sunflowers.
So this autistic guy who struggles to connect with people that he's not met before,
has reached out in time and space and is connecting with all these strangers. And in
a uniquely intimate and dynamic way. I can't understate how important this is to me. I love
humans but I can only experience them in small doses. This way I get to have intimate conversations
with lots of people without even having to be there. How amazing is that? It's also probably
worth reflecting that I do all this right now via a local art community. I'd recently moved to where
I am now in rural Scotland and I didn't know anyone. The idea that I would just go out and
talk to people felt ridiculous. But I knew I needed to go meet people. And I knew I wanted
to start sharing my art again and in the real world, not just online. So I started an arts
community. On reflection, this is very much a symptom of my overall inability to instigate
connections, as backward as that sounds. But by starting a community around my art,
I had a reason to speak to people about something I knew that I could relate to them about. And
because I was at the centre of it, at least at the beginning, they kind of had to talk to me.
But I soon realised the impact I was having on their lives and how many others like me were out
there. Also, a death metal appreciation society in a small rural town was unlikely to get many
members. Maybe I'll start that one online. Or maybe I'm wrong. Drop me a line if you're in
arse end of nowhere Scotland and feel the need to sit around and chat about cannibal corpse,
because I'm in. Anyway, I digress. We can talk about death metal another day, I promise.
Back to the art. I think that every artist gets something different from sharing their works.
To name but a tiny fraction of possible motivations. Money, attention, the thrill of
performance, delighting others, to protest, make people laugh, to make people cry, to have a reason
to get out of the house, or because, well, you just got to. I could go on and on. But whatever it is,
it's always about connection, at least from the artist's perspective. Art is communication. It's
not only about communication, but in itself it is a form of communication, and perhaps the most
effective one of all. We'll talk more as we go on about this, as well as the broader value and
necessity of art to a healthy society. But today I'm really interested in the personal experience
and the conversations you have with people about your art. And it's amazing what people will tell
you. Things like how your art reached them, enriched their lives, made them feel seen, moved them,
sometimes to tears, made them angry or sad or joyous or calm. People's reactions sometimes seem
bonkers to me. I mean, it's just a painting, people. But it's amazing always, and I mean always.
When you're really low, it's sometimes hard to feel that you have any worth at all. Maybe you
get some solace in the artistic process, but it can feel selfish, solitary, perhaps even indulgent and
self-centered. The idea that you could help someone else to reach someone in any capacity seems
ludicrous. How can this broken person help fix someone else? I've been in places where I felt
completely worthless, and more often than I'd like to admit, and for no good reason really. But I
justified it to myself. I told myself stories, made myself believe that I was right to feel that way.
This is the way that it works. Misery is self-perpetuating. The last time this happened to
me was quite recently actually. Due to various circumstances, I'd crashed. I was not a well
person, and it was leaking out everywhere. I needed to stop, take stock, heal, but I felt that
I couldn't. I was already committed to doing a bunch of stuff that meant I needed to put myself
and my art out there, for various reasons. Not least because I was the organiser of the event,
and me not turning up would put a bunch of people out and make me feel a whole bunch more worthless.
So I did it, even though I really didn't want to. I found some energy from somewhere.
Then people came and spoke to me and told me what my art meant to them, and what this exhibition
that I'd organised meant to them. They said I'd made a real difference. How works like mine
had helped dig them out of a hole. Me, this hollowed out husk. It all struck me as so bizarre.
How could this broken useless shell help anyone? How could someone who struggles to reach people
on a good day actually create light in their lives on a bad one? I think if you've been to a
psychological place like that, you'll know that your adult brain tries to fight anything positive,
like it's allergic to hope. The nasty chattering demon that put you there in the first place
doesn't shut up. But it did make a difference. A huge difference. Because I didn't feel useless
anymore. Yes, I was still exhausted and broken. In some ways the worst was still to come as my
situation in the real world continued to worsen. But I faced that stuff down with renewed strength
because I felt like I mattered. These are the building blocks of recovery, and this time a
recovery that took a lot less time than it usually would. And those little threads of positivity I
spun spread and created a web, some of which I could see via the positive repercussions of that
event, and others that I knew would be there. Because I knew that any sliver of hope in my world
made a difference, and so any little glimmer of positivity I can create in another's world
must create ripples of positivity that spread. Even if they only spread a little way, they matter.
Small things matter. Every little gift counteracts a small hurt. Every sliver of light, no matter how
small, gives someone who is suffering a reason to carry on. And as an artist you're in the privileged
position to be able to create such moments by doing something that you love. In a way it's your job,
whether you know it or not. There are many other benefits to sharing your work. Here's a few.
You've got both an excuse and room to make more art, meeting other creatives, seeing your art in
its natural environment, the potential to make some extra money, and maybe a lot of extra money,
contributing to the progressions of the art form. So just do it. Art for art's sake. Taking the step
of sharing your art is harder for some than others. Harder at the beginning than later on.
Well, most of the time. Maybe you think it's too hard for you, and that's fine. You're in good
company. But if your objection to sharing your art to other people is really just hesitancy, trebidation,
or fear, I urge you to push past it, because the world needs you. The world needs art.
Your homework this time is simple. Go experience another artist or creator's work.
This could mean reading or re-reading a book or a poem, listening to music, listening to a podcast,
anything creative really. It needs to be a living creator, so not JMW Turner or anyone like that,
and not someone who already gets heaps of attention. I think Taylor Swift can do without
you for a bit, but someone who needs it. Get in touch with them and tell them how it made you feel.
However you can find to do that. Email, social media feeds, website comments, record a video.
Tell them how their art made you feel. Do this for multiple artists if you want,
and if you find someone new to this game, someone inexperienced, then all the better. Go create a
bit of life in another artist's life. Let them know that they're appreciated. This will definitely
not be the last time I cover this subject. Next time, well, next time I'm not sure. I've got a
couple of episodes scripted and in the bag, and I'm not sure which one to share next, and some of
them I want to work on a bit more, so I'm afraid it's going to be a surprise, but tune in to find
out. I hope you enjoyed this episode and found it helpful. If you did, I'd love for you to support
