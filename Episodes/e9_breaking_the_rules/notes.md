## Content Development Notes

### Potential Chapter Themes

### Writing Considerations
- Alex's authentic voice must be preserved

## Questions for Alex
- Should Pathological Demand Avoidance be explained more thoroughly?
- Are there other rule-breaking techniques not mentioned here?
- How much color theory detail is appropriate for general audience?
- Any specific Mucha works to highlight as examples?

## Editorial Notes
- "Intensive purposes" should be "intents and purposes" (appears twice)
- Otherwise transcript appears clean and ready for use
- Alex's grammar and punctuation breaking is intentional (Joyce/Woolf reference)

## Therapeutic Application Notes

- Addresses imposter syndrome directly
- Emphasizes process over product for mental health
- Validates neurodivergent creative experiences

## Bibliography Research Needed
- Principia Mathematica details and publication info

- Turner Prize archives for Martin Creed work
- Miles Davis "Kind of Blue" album details

## Future Development
- This episode pairs well with experimentation and process-focused episodes
- Strong foundation for neurodivergent creativity chapter
- Rule-breaking theme could span multiple chapters
