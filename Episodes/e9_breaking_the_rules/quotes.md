# Episode 9: Breaking the Rules - Significant Quotes

## Core Philosophy

> "There is, according to some people, a right way and a wrong way of doing things. This is an assertion I usually disagree with."

> "So the idea that there is, for example, only one way to approach creating an oil painting of an apple on a plate has a strong stench of nonsense."

## Personal Expression and Black Paint

> "But here's the thing. I like black. I use it all the time. I've got over a hundred black t-shirts."

> "And if Mucha does it, then you can bet your last pair of clean knickers that I do too."

> "Maybe you think that my art is no better than that of a playschool kid, but I think it looks great. And if it grates on some people that I use thick black lines around my humans, those are just the sort of people I exist to be the metaphorical lemon juice in the eye of."

## Rule Categories and Social Pressure

> "Some dictates fall into the more dangerous category of you can't do that, it's cheating. Or the slightly less alarming but somehow more insidious, that's just not how we do things darling."

> "The application of such techniques and approaches not only risks creating something less than perfect, or perhaps more than perfect, but to be discovered using them risks actual social ostracisation or ridicule."

## Process and Therapeutic Value

> "You see, my process is filled up with bits that are either necessary for the outcomes that I see or that I find pleasurable or relaxing to do. And since relaxation is the primary goal, I tend to prioritize the stuff that facilitates that."

> "Which means less fiddling with the exact position of a nose and more soothing, mindful shading. Remember geography class when you used to find trying to color inside the country boundaries oddly relaxing? It's like that."

## Mental Health and Imposter Syndrome

> "Let me state this with absolute clarity. Self-doubt, of which imposter syndrome is a form and its ugly cousin, low self-esteem, are arguably the biggest enemies of good mental health."

> "For a long time, I wouldn't talk about my technique and approaches to art because I was afraid that someone would call me out, which is of course completely irrational."

## Neurodivergence and Rules

> "Us weirdos tend to have spent most of our existence being told by some person or another in one way or another that some thing or another that we are doing or being was somehow wrong."

> "It's an odd quirk of the autistic mind that we both feel compelled to follow rules while being pathologically hostile to rules that seem to us to be stupid."

> "So we tend to be staunch, law-abiding citizens while aggressively shunning all the various unfathomable social conventions, at least the ones where we think we can get away with doing so."

## Art Philosophy and Uniqueness

> "If things aren't nice, they ain't art. So Bob Ross and Coldplay are art, but Martin Creed and Napalm Death aren't."

> "Art, for me at least, is about creation, and therefore dull reproduction and repetition barely qualifies."

> "If something is presented as art, then it is art. A can of soup on a supermarket shelf is not a work of art, but if you can convince someone to put it in a gallery, then it is."

> "The point is repetition is the death of art. Any item reproduced in sufficient numbers degrades the value to the point where it is worthless and anything that has no intrinsic worth cannot, by definition, be art."

> "If repetition is the death of art, then uniqueness is its beating heart. Art thrives on novelty. Art requires novelty."

## Rules vs. Innovation

> "And you know what stifles novelty? Rules. Bloody rules. In fact it's arguable that rules exist specifically to curb novelty."

> "Deep Blue didn't beat Kasparov by sticking to convention."

## Context and Timing

> "Art, or indeed any creation that in retrospect can be tagged as ahead of its time, was in its time considered pointless drivel and subjected to ridicule or more likely completely ignored."

> "And those others are almost always the very gatekeepers of taste and decorum that gleefully creates the rules to which you find yourself on the wrong side of. It's a catch-22."

## Practical Advice

> "But from my perspective, learn the rules. Don't. It's not important. Rules are only important if they get in the way of you enjoying yourself."

> "But you can be sure that if they started getting in my way I would drop them without missing a beat."

## Final Message

> "If art is to be your release, then you need to feel unconstrained and you need to value the work that you produce, regardless of what others may think of it. Otherwise, the process is always going to feel unsatisfactory and confining, and having some real fun will seem like a guilty pleasure, rather than the blossoming it should be."

> "No homework this time, just be yourself. Go revel in it."
