welcome to the art against mental illness podcast my name is Alex lovess and this is my podcast about the healing powers of art for artists art lovers the art curious and anyone with an interest in mental health and well-being the two frers sit on a bench their hands clasped tightly left Freda we'll call her European Freda is wearing a high necked European style wedding dress right Freda Mexican Freda wears a Tiana dress traditional to her Mexican heritage both freda's hearts are visible Mexican freda's heart appears healthy while European freda's heart seems damaged broken perhaps and can be seen through a hole ripped in the breast of her dress in her right hand European Freeda hold surgical forceps that have cut a major blood vessel from her heart it leaks blood onto her wedding dress Mexican Freda holds a miniature portrait of her ex-husband Mexican artist Diego Rivera from whom she recently divorced blood vessel connects to this portrait from her heart her dress is intact and clean both fredas stare resolutely at the viewer seemingly defiant yet European Freda seems paler diminished frailer the painting The Two fredas by iconic Mexican painter Freda Carlo is a wash with autobiographical symbolism it canas Duality as well as both Symmetry and asymmetry strength and weakness European and Mexican it's rolent with pain from her divorce from her husband but Resolute and forthright in challenging that pain the artwork Tells A Tale of sorrow but solidarity with oneself Carlo admitted it expressed her desperation and loneliness with a separation from Diego but still she shows solidarity with herself tender and comforting yet proud and supportive of the 143 paintings that Carlo produced in her lifetime 55 were self-portraits of some form all depicting similarly expositional and confessional themes exposing her personal life political views and her chronic and cryp health problems she was famously quoted as saying I paint myself because I am so often alone and because I am the subject that I know best here's me rounding off episode seven of this podcast in which I talked about telling stories with art I just want to say something quickly about the fact that I spend a lot of time in this podcast telling my own story I'm autistic as I've said before and autistic people have a tendency to relate to other people by telling their own stories it's a way of empathizing it can make autistic people come across as being quite selfish or self-centered or single-minded and it's not that way at all it's just that we find it much easier to relate to someone by telling other people's stories about ourselves autistic people tend to be great storytellers I have a suspicion that Carlo was autistic we relate to others by relating ourselves she was showing us herself so that we might better understand ourselves I'm not going to talk much about autism here but it does highlight an aspect of the Arts that is perhaps p fully understood and by being so often leads to artists hampering their own progress and stifling the ability of art to heal that is ego narcissus was a mythological Greek dude who was ridiculously attractive he was shown his own reflection in the pool of Water by the goddess of Retribution Nemesis this was the first time he'd ever seen himself in all his hotness on seeing his delectable Visage he immediately falls in love with himself and can't tear his beautiful eyes away depending on which version of me you're reading he either falls into a pool and drowns or Wast the way on the plus side the gods posthumously transformed him into a flower that grows by The wat's Edge psychological diagnostic Bible the diagnostic and statistical Manual of mental disorders AKA DSM States the first criteria of narcissistic personality disorder as a grandio sense of self-importance narcissism is a real thing as anyone who pays attention to the incessant ranting of Donald Trump will know but would you call Freda Carlo narcissistic how about Vincent Van go who produced 36 self-portraits or rembrand who produced nearly 80 self-portraits I talk a lot about myself and my own Journey on this podcast that's partly because this is me this is my life I started up a podcast about mental health and art because these two things are for one reason or another really important to me but just as importantly I want to help other people and one of the best ways to do that is to share your own stories so that others can empathize it can really help people with similar struggles to rationalize their own situations or at the very least to feel like they're not alone I don't mind the sound of my own voice I've got used to it over the years and I do like the things that I say I like the things that I write and as I've said many times before on this podcast the reason you know you're producing good work is because you like it and if you like it then someone else is going to like it but maybe this all comes across a bit narcissistic but we're all the stars of our own movie and whether or not you've got a plane sized ego you're the center of your own universe and through everything you've experienced left your childhood home Found Love a career had kids one way or another you're still viewing it from your perspective it's the only point of view that you've got the best you can try to do is understand and rationalize and empathize with someone else's situation where our situations cross over where we have aspects of our life overlap with similar aspects of someone else's life then we can relate on that level and communicate and hopefully help each other out or at least under understand and empathize talking about yourself is important it's why therapy is such a big industry you don't have to have a big ego for that to be the case this is a podcast about art and whether you're a Creator or a consumer art is inherently personal and subjective I've talked before about how when you share an artwork with the world you let go of it and it takes on a life and a meaning of its own it's not yours anymore the experience of it belongs to the viewer it's not really about you anymore but when you created it it was and from your perspect perspective it always will be as a Creator It's Not Unusual to find yourself in a situation where someone sees a work you made and says something like I interpret this as a really cheerful Serene affirming work and you look at it and go no mate I was miserable when I made that that was like the worst part of my life there's always going to be some level of Disconnect between you and your audience and that's just the nature of the beast but whether or not you communicate your motivations or the meaning behind the work of art whether or not that's understood and relatable by the person who viewed that art you had those motivations and you chose the subject you chose the narrative you chose the colors the framing you chose the length the size you chose the medium and where and when to show it and all of those are very personal to you it might just be personal to your life situation at that moment maybe you had to show it at that specific moment because that was the only time the exhibition space was available maybe you painted a blue picture because that was the only color of paint you had left maybe you made that haunting think piece because you are at that moment well haunted all art is autobiographical whether you want it to be or not you may choose to try and obfuscate your true self or your true nature in your works but that choice is autobiographical in itself the same is true for any Act of Creation by humans be it a mathematical proof or development of a new technology or baking a loaf of bread we put a flavor of ourselves in everything that we do everyone of not in culture of note because of the choices they've made based on the type of person they are given the opportunities they were given our world centers around humans and humans have their stories and those stories contribute to whatever impact that human has on the world be it a tragic infant who never made it to their first Birthday to someone who lived to 110 years old in both instances they made a fundamental impact on the world the people around them for Better or For Worse and created reverberations that would be felt across people communities and time you might might argue that say a documentary photographer or a realist landscape painter or a nature illustrator have the responsibility to transmit the subject honestly and accurately to ultimately be invisible which they may well do but in all these cases they had to choose the subject the framing the rendering and depending on how important they are within their field they might be more important than their subject anyway the idea that a work of art is of the same value independently of the knowledge of who the Creator is doesn't stand up to scrutiny say you owned a beautiful landscape that was given to you by a friend or you found at a car boot sale or something you love it but you don't have that much attachment to it it cost you a tenor or whatever when you moved house it just got chucked in the back of a van and it seen its fair share of splatter of beverages from children and drunk uncles what then if you on a whim took it to the Antiques Road show only to discover in fact that this is a long lost Constable landscape auction value of a million quid plus you're saying that that painting hasn't gone up in your estimation that you don't suddenly see details and flourishes that you didn't see before that you don't start treating it reverently and with great care identity matters in art the very idea that Jimmy Hendrick touched a particular guitar can exponentially increase its value Andy warhole never set foot in the same room as many of the works of Arts attributed to him yet they still sell for tens of thousands of dollars what matters is that he chose to depict those soup tins the soup tins weren't the point the point was warh and his message you can't help but get in the way of your subject the subject is only the subject because you made it so and this is a subject I've touched upon before and will likely do so many times again the idea that you can separate an artwork from the artist and have it hold the same meaning and value is ridiculous art is created by humans as a means to interact with other humans for human interaction to occur there needs to be two sides of that communication despite how incredibly humanlike chat Bots are getting most people can tell when they're talking to one and we preferred to be talking to a human in any case art is culture that happens between and among humans not machines and humans not dolphins and humans not dogs and humans yes a creation can have inherent Beauty worth and craftsmanship but when that is disembodied from the person who created it it loses part of its meaning and therefore its cultural value an artwork without an artist is just an object do you honestly think that Marcel du Champ's urinol would have had the same cultural meaning if we didn't know who put it there what Val of Banks's murals until we know who it was that painted them this doesn't mean that your Creations are worthless until you share them you still love them they just carry little to no cultural currency this also doesn't mean that if you are largely unknown your art is similarly valueless your art has value and utility to 100% of its existing audience the same rules apply if your painting turns up in a jumo Cell without a signature and a DI hard fan sees it and is unable to attribute it to you then they will view it as of lower value so let me repeat everything you do everything you create is to at least some degree about you this doesn't mean that all art is narcissistic rather than taking all the attention you're giving a piece of you away if someone unknown to you experiences your Creation in a book or an art gallery or a theater and you're not there to suck up the accolades or the derision for that matter then your ego simply isn't part of the equation most artists tend to be self-deprecating anyway and therefore get slightly Twitchy of someone hungrily consuming their art especially if their artwork is quite personal and many of us have nightmares about champagne sipping socialite art establishment snobs delightfully denigrating our loved Creations far from being an ego trip it's at best a terrifying ego roller coaster and at worst ego destruction so not only can you not extract yourself from your art it's pretty essential that you are to some degree at least on show and far from being narcissistic in most cases the ACT is selfless to a destructive degree you should embrace this reality or at least accept it and not feel shy when your art expresses something directly about you celebrate that art is a means of communication it is about conveying your experience Vision thoughts your feelings your point of view and your worldview and communicating it to other people in some form so you're out and about and you see something cool like a stunning view or an interesting happening or some Landmark you take a picture with your phone and you send it to a friend or share it on social saying look at this cool thing I just saw maybe you strike a pose and make it a selfie that act in it self is an Act of Creation because the Act of Creation in itself is an act of choice you choose what to photograph or video you choose what to paint you choose how to paint it you choose what story to tell and you choose whether or not to put yourself in it this is just what we do we as humans want need to communicate with other humans we want to tell people about our experiences our successes our landmarks our nice lunch no one else really cares about that poorly framed photo of the Taj Mahal they care that you took it and that you were there looking hot in both senses of the word in fact your humanity and your presence in your history your life your reputation your influence the color of your skin your height the tone of your voice these are all things that send signals to other humans about you and the thing that you're conveying and it's in escapable you can try and change it but there's only so far you can go with this your Communications your interface with the world is your identity some people choose to expose and mediate that via selfies and 30 second videos some choose to paint a bowl of fruit that took them weeks to create some dance some write erotic fanfiction about vampires the intersection of who you are as a person and how you choose to portray yourself defines your message and how it's perceived this doesn't always go a plan Vanilla Ice Springs to mind but it is what it is and it is you some folks going to like that some folks don't maybe you like what I make how I present myself to the world maybe you don't I hope you do but it's not a prerequisite this is just me I do what I do if you don't like it don't listen at some point I figured out that I'm fairly articul and I'm very open with my own experiences almost pathologically so and I've used that to both my detriment and to my benefit and starting up this podcast was a recognition of that despite the fact that I was old and barely articulate as a kid I've learned how to communicate pretty well and therefore in terms of carrying message by the medium of talking to people who are not in the same physical space as me I'm quite well placed and part of that is me talking autobiographically it's a recognition of the part of myself that knows stuff and likes to talk and because of the way that I say things people are inclined to listen and derive value from the things I say at least I hope so either way this is how I choose to portray myself and it's as much an expression of my creative identity as my paintings are I've got a bit of a ritual every year I make a submission to portray artist of the year for those listeners not in the UK this is a TV show where artists attempt to portray a celebrity sitter in 4 hours it's a pretty big thing for the UK Arts community to enter you submit a self-portrait five or six years ago I thought I was in with a chance I paint people pretty well so I made a self-portrait a pretty good one and submitted it for judging I was of course rejected as I have been every year since it's become a bit of a grim annual ritual but it's been responsible for me producing six or seven self-portraits that document my journey both as an artist and an individual through the intervening years before I started this podcast it was the closest thing I had to a diary each painting is distinct in style reflecting my Approach at that time each reflects my interest and obsessions of the time each shows me changing ever so slightly as a human and this of course is why Carlo Rembrandt van goof and many many other artists produced self- portrays no not because they wanted to be on some reality TV show but to explicitly document their journey in the way that they knew best how to do so but of course neither they nor I needed those self-portraits I already have a document of my progression as an artist it's called all my other artworks the self-portraits are among the least interesting of my works paradoxically I find it difficult and uncomfortable depicting myself with any level of honesty or Clarity I just don't think about myself as an entity in the real world I don't live out there looking in I live in here looking out I have no idea how people see me or how I would see myself where I able to step outside myself for a while the Alex that you're listening to now and the Alex in those self-portraits is no more the real me than the Alex that turns up at job interviews or the one that lurks around awkwardly at his own art exhibitions if for whatever bizarre reason you want a glimpse Inside the Mind of the real me you have to look at my works as a whole it's like a giant quilt of outputs and experiences that will continue to expand until I keill over or find a more profitable hobby as is my habit I've got a bit meta here since I'm being autobiographical in an attempt to justify the autobiographic nature of my own work in an attempt to explain the autobiographic nature of creativity in itself all the while trying to convince you that I'm not a raving ego maniac and maybe I am but aren't we all of course the iron of all this talk about putting yourself on display and being narcissistic is that whereas most artists feel like imposters narcissists are fakers who don't have the capacity to realize that they're imposters in any Arena especially in the modern attention economy the higher echelons are cramped with chances and gobshites who have no real business being there and have crowded out those that do they make the most noise dominating attention and disc course and keeping everyone else out of contention it's arguable that professional art is at or near the top of the list of Arenas crammed with narcissistic charlatans I'd say that it was at the top but the tech industry seems to have zoomed past in spectacular fashion this is a fact of the world and the prevalence of chances es and flows what's more frustrating is that true artists broadcast their authenticity whether they like it or not and the consumer will pick up on it in a second if they try and grab a bit more Limelight by compromising their individuality it's both a frustration and a compliment that true creatives are held to a higher standard with great power comes great responsibility but maybe small Bank balances and as I've alluded to the opposite of narcissism is impostor syndrome it's a subject that is a close companion to the subjects covered here it's such a big part of an artist's daily experience that I think it's worth at least the whole episode so although it's a natural progression to this conversation I'll leave that one for another day so what's my point with all of this don't be afraid to let you you leak or even gush out into your work because you're going to whether you want to or not you don't have to repeatedly paint yourself like Fredy Carlo or make yourself a living artwork like Yoko Ono or David Bowe but if you try to remove yourself from your art then you're not only making things unnecessarily difficult for yourself but you're also leeching out the most important bit and the bit that everyone else wants to see you worse by trying to crowd yourself out of the process the process will feel force and artificial and will inevitably be less fulfilling this can easily lead to frustration and fuel impostor syndrome none of this bods well for the therapeutic value of art it's also worth noting that you are not a fixed entity and you will change over time I covered this quite a bit in my episode on finding your voice as you change so should your voice otherwise you'll find yourself editing the real you out of your art anyway so make sure you're there now and always it's neither vain nor narcissistic to do so in fact it's necessary so you do you in all your glorious technical and bollocks to the haters right I'm off to record my first interview episode this afternoon hopefully that goes well and I'll share it with you all really looking forward to that in the meantime please like review and share this podcast follow me on Blue Sky at Alex Loveless artist.
