Nobody can miss them for me
That's reason why I try both
If all is old, I can see a thousand times all day
Out against mental illness
If all is old, I can see a thousand times all day
You humans wouldn't know real art if it walked up and poked you in your woefully inadequate vision organs
Did you know that Shakespeare's plays were actually written by a hyper-intelligent smear of oily gunk that rode to earth on a meteor?
Not even as creative as oily gunk, I ask you
You couldn't make it up
Well you lot bloody well couldn't that's for sure
Only joking, I'm still here
As you can tell I've been having some fun with AI
I'll come back to that in a minute
This is one of my occasional therapeutic outlet episodes where I let myself range a little bit more freely
And talk about things I want to talk about
And this one is about changes because I've had some changes again in my life
This time a little bit more positive
And so I wanted to talk about changes in general
And one of those changes, as the Alex Bot says
I just got a contract that came in out of nowhere
So I've got some work for the first time in a while
And I started pretty much immediately
So I'm working now
So that immediately posed a problem for me
With regards to how to continue my increasing portfolio of podcasts
Which will take quite a while to write, record and edit and publish
And so I'm looking for ways to try and make that a little bit easier
Because I really don't want to stop doing this
And so I obviously got sucked down an AI rabbit hole as I tend to do
Which was of limited success
But I did have fun doing it
And that included using a large language model to build an Alex Bot
Which essentially is supposed to emulate the way that I write in my voice
In my writing voice, using my vernacular and my opinions
And way of stating things
Which is okay
And also when I was doing that I thought it would be great if obviously it could do it in my voice as well
And I remembered the app that I used to record and edit this
Which is called Descript
Has an AI voice function so it can clone a voice
You can have it
You can have stuff read in in all sorts of fairly decent
Who the completely sympathetic voice is
But this one claims to be able to clone my voice
And that's what you heard
Which I think is quite interesting
It makes me sound like Marvin the paranoid android
And hence the whole Alex Bot spiel that you heard there
It's quite disturbing to hear yourself
I mean I wonder who it is that's using these things to actually record podcasts and publish them
But maybe you think that sounds exactly like me
I hope I've got a little bit more life in me than that
But good on Alex Bot
And if he really is going to take over my life in the world then better Alex Bot than someone else Bot, right?
So I actually wrote the script for that Alex Bot section
But obviously I created an Alex Writing Bot too
So what happens when I get Alex Writing Bot and Alex Narrating Bot to work together
And so I asked it to write a small piece of Art Against Mental Illness themed text
So I asked Alex Bot to give me less than a hundred words on using creativity to manage change in your life
And this is what it gave me
So creativity, using it to cope with life's curvy balls
Well I reckon it's like this, life throws shit at you, right? Changes upheavals the whole shebang
Now you can either sit there and let it bury you or you can grab a brush, a pen, a guitar, whatever
And start making something out of the mess
For me Art's always been that escape route, that way to channel the chaos into something else
It's not about ignoring the bad stuff but about finding a way to process it, to tell a story with it
And sometimes that story ends up being bloody beautiful, even if it started out as a right disaster
So yeah, creativity, lifesaver mate, a few more mentally healthy people in the world can't be a bad thing, right?
Well that was all the fun, wasn't it? Would I actually say it like that? Ish
Yeah, it doesn't really sound like me, but fine
I don't think he'll be taking over for me anytime soon, but perhaps you think he should
Answers on the postcard, send them to your recycling bin
Anyway, back to my wonderfully exciting life
I've been in a bit of stasis for quite a long time now
I'm not going to recount the whole history of it
There are plenty of prior episodes that document my sorry story
But I haven't worked for a while, and we've been running out of money
And it's been really hard to see past this
That nothing seemed to be changing
I was really struggling to find work
Having assumed that it would be easy for me in my day job as a data scientist
People like me have been very much in demand, but I'm in the UK
The UK trashed its own economy and continues to do so
And so investment I think has been quite low
And businesses haven't been taking risks
And as an independent contractor like me, companies were not employing us
And I know it's not just me
There are quite a few other people I know in my area who've really struggled too
And so it became really difficult for me to envision a future past
This continuing fugue state that I've been in
And as money dwindled and hope sort of leaked away
Using my creativity to try and buoy me up
But at the back of my mind, constantly worrying that I mean this was it, right?
Maybe my day job career is over
Maybe I've got to try something completely different
The art and creativity side of my world doesn't really earn me any money either
And you start to feel really worthless
And you've got no value in society
Now I'm not going to get lost down the rabbit hole of why
That it's completely bonkers that we have imposed on ourselves
This capitalist regime that demands that your personal worth in the world, in the universe, to the human race
Is tied to your ability to earn money
But that's the reality of the society that I live in
And it's very easy to become despondent
And lose your self-esteem
And to become hopeless
And I've been a lot better
I've had some extremely profound mental health problems over the last year and longer
And I've been a lot better recently
Partly due to chemical interventions
And partly due to me just getting past the worst of my problems
And getting my situation and burying myself in all sorts of really fun creative activities
Not least recording a podcast
And my life was sort of simmering away like that for quite a while
And the anxiety and that sense of helplessness doesn't go away
I just managed to push it back a bit into the background
It was just a sort of background noise like tinnitus
But like tinnitus it's always there
And every time you stop thinking about something else
You hear the tinnitus, you hear the ringing
It's always there and it's really, really grinding
It's like having a stone in your shoe
I always kept the hope up though
And tried to keep the hope up for my family and the people around me
Because I knew that things can just change in a second
And it's frustrating because knowing that you sort of sit there going
Well can't you just change now? How about now?
And you're sort of trying to will circumstances to change
And obviously there's some stuff you can do about that
And that's precisely the problem
All the things that I thought I needed to do
All the things that people told me to do, they weren't working
And I was running out of ideas as to how to change my situation
And it started to sort of learn helplessness
And just sort of bed in for the long term
But I always knew that things could change at any minute
And that's sometimes very comforting
And other times it's just cold comfort
It's like you're pouring out your heart to someone or your problems
And they go there, there, it's all going to get better
Things will be better and you're like, yeah, great, thanks
How does that help me right now?
And it sort of does and it sort of doesn't
And so it was really a waiting game
I wasn't doing nothing to try and change my circumstances
It's just that my avenues just kept drying up
And then a couple of weeks ago out of nowhere
And an old colleague is actually, previously my boss's boss
A job that I did a decade ago
Got in touch and says, you know, I've got a client, he runs a consultancy
He said, I've got a client that needs some of exactly what you do
And they need it right now
And are you free?
And I was like, well, let me check my diary
And I checked my diary and there was nothing in it, funnily enough, at all
And I was like, well, yeah, of course
I'm totally available
I tried not to sound too excited or either enthusiastic
Like a little puppy barking at his ankles
And we didn't even need to do interviews or anything
I knew this guy knows me of old and knows what I do and what I'm capable of
And just went and sold my work to his client
And they were like, well, we trust you, so we trust this guy
And so there we go
It took a little bit longer than I'd originally thought, about a week longer
Which was quite nerve-wracking
You know, because the client could always have said no
And these things can always fall apart
And as a long-term contractor, like a freelancer, if you would prefer
I learned a very long time ago that you don't count the chickens
And in this case, you don't count on the money until at the very least
You've got the signed contract in your hands to say that we commit to pay you this money
And even then, it's no guarantee
But at that point, you can start to think, yeah, okay, this is happening
And so it took a little while for that to happen
And not a lot longer at all, but in some ways it felt like an ice age
And then I was just working
And it was really both absolutely bizarre and then totally normal at the same time
Because I'm good at what I do
If you want to talk about it in terms of the 10,000 hours
I've massively overshot the 10,000 hours needed for the expertise of what I do
And so I just slipped into it
It's like driving a car or riding a bike, I was just doing it again
And I had some anxiety that I would have forgotten how to do all of it
Which I haven't, really
There's a few slightly patchy areas that I needed to remind myself of
But I was up and running and really enjoying myself remembering that I'm good at this
And also remembering that this has value, the work that I do
I'm not going to go into the job that I do, maybe one day
Maybe one day you want to hear it, but that's not really for this podcast
I have another podcast, if you want to know more about that
It's called The Confusion Matrix
It's me and my business partner, Pete Hodge
We discuss things about data science
It's me and him just shooting the breeze
Having fun and talking about stuff that interests us in that arena
So go look for that anywhere you get your podcasts
I think we're on episode five now
Another podcast that I have to find a way to keep running
Anyway, where did I digress from?
So I was still good at this
And it was just like I'd never stopped
And it's been such a long time and that felt so weird to me that this is just like normal
And normal for good and normal for bad
And getting back in the corporate world and remembering very, very quickly
How challenging it can be
Especially when you've got a brain like mine
But they're good people
It's an interesting project
The work's really challenging
And it's only for a few weeks at this point anyway
But those few weeks are going to make such a huge difference to my life
And it's given me a huge confidence boost
But sitting in front of the computer thinking
Well this is not normal
At this point I'd usually be in my workshop
Carving holes in bits of wood or something
And sort of thinking how weird it was that it didn't really feel that weird
And also thinking, well I was right about the stuff changing thing, wasn't I?
But it takes a while for that, for the anxieties to go away
And it takes a while for that feeling of dread to dissipate
And it still hasn't dissipated
I still sort of can't believe it and don't really believe it
And indeed as a contractor the other not counting chickens thing is
Not assuming you're home and dry until the money's in the bank
And it isn't yet
But I fully expect it to be, I have confidence
I trust the people I'm working with
So hopefully there'll be no hiccups there
And so yeah, I'm just really pleased
And I don't know how long this is going to go on for
But in the meantime it buys me massive amounts of headroom
Allows me to sort of relax a bit
And to start to think a little bit more about what we might do from here
I think I'm a little wild from coming to any conclusions on that
But watch this space
Anyway, finding myself back in front of my computer at my desk quite a lot
I found it unsatisfactory having this environment around me all of the time
Because I was used to sort of being able to do whatever I wanted
Go to my workshop or go out for walks and stuff
And you know, I like my job, I like doing what I do
But I don't really like being stuck in front of a screen all day
But I thought at the very least I needed to sort of make this environment better
Because it was really cluttered and cramped and sort of not very pleasant
And so one of the things I needed was a laptop riser of some sort
To raise my laptop up
Firstly so that my camera is at the right height and my screen is at the right height
So I don't get back problems
And the other reason is because to achieve that goal
I had a pile of books
And those books were taking up a lot of space on my desk
It was quite hard for me to, you know, maneuver my mouse, for example
And I was like, what I need is one of these stands that has a sort of shelf on it
So that the laptop is, and the books are not taking up so much space
It's got an overhang
I jumped onto Amazon and started looking for these
Thinking, you know, I've got some money and then remembering that I don't really
And until that money comes in I can't spend it
And also, you know, you look at these things on Amazon
It's just tat for a tenner these days
And it's probably fine
But, you know, looking at some of these contraptions
I was like, well, that doesn't really do what I want
So let's have a look at another one
It's okay, it doesn't really do what I want either
And then I was like, I just make one, right?
And, you know, I'm surrounded by wood and woodworking stuff at the moment
Because of my weird pivot into wood carving and so on
I'm not actually very good at making real life things with wood
But I do it from time to time
I've got enough confidence and enough materials and equipment
To construct things that actually have some real world purpose
And so I thought, why don't I make myself a laptop stand?
And so I did it
And it felt really good
And I'm not the sort of person that's just going to sit around thinking about it
And then go up and look up a YouTube video on how to do something like this
And I just went out to my workshop and was like, here's some bits of wood
Right, what if I did this? I'll screw this onto here
I'll add this stand on here and I need a little hook there
And there's a little storage space over here
Oh, I need something to tidy my cables
And I just started playing around and just kept on building
And I was like, oh my God, this has got to be stable enough
It can't tip over, so what do I have to do?
And it was just so much fun
And it was just an act of necessity, but an act of creativity
And I'm really pleased with it
It's on my desk now, it's a bit ramshackle
I didn't bother trying to make it nicely, neatly cut
Or painting it, you know, some beautiful color and sheen
I just screwed bits of wood on here and there and you'll bit a metal
And repurposed, like I've got a headphone holder on it
Which is some old bit of metal that was for something similar
That I'd sort of cut up and repurposed
And just used things around me that I had
And I don't really care what it looks like, I just care that it's functional
But for me it's quite beautiful because I made it
And it really does the job, and it's very very satisfying
That I get to exist with it on a day to day basis
And it's providing me value
And of course I got it on my desk and worked with it for a day or two
And I was like, oh this is not quite right
And I didn't do that bit properly and it needs a bit of this or bit of that
And I just took it back out and I changed it
And I added to it and I made it better
And I will continue to do that
And that's so much better than buying from some tap for a tenner
From Amazon or somewhere else
To get something that feels flimsy
Or to spend buttloads of money on something that feels really classy
And then have it not be quite right
Or have to change the way that you're working to suit it
And therefore what are you going to do?
You have to either just live with it or buy a new one
And that's how capitalism works, they want you to buy a new one
Well I just don't want to live with that
I got to fix this and it took me an hour or two
And it does exactly what I want
I've made no compromises here
And I think that the point I'm making here is that
Yes of course I've got back to the old routine at least for a while
But it hasn't really changed the sort of habits that I developed
While I wasn't working
And the scarcity of the last 18 months in my life
Has really pushed me into being much more creative and experimental and resourceful
Which is much more who I am at my core
I was earning a good salary for quite a long time and I just got lazy
And because if I wanted something more often than not
I'm not buying Ferraris but if I wanted a new laptop stand I'd buy it
And I could because I could afford it
And now I'm like well no
Almost everything I think I need to get or buy
I second guess myself and think well is there another way I can achieve this
And not only does it save me money
It really gives me pleasure
And it really allows me to sort of flex my creative muscles and to learn something
And I consider that a gift
This slightly ramshackle laptop stand made out of bits of old
I mean literally these are bits of wood that I discovered in a shed out the back
I think that the main support for this is chopped up fence posts
I kid you not
And I didn't even treat them or anything I sanded them a bit
They've not been varnished or anything
I don't care I might give this a paint job at some point as a little treat to myself
But until I'm happy with it and I'm not going to change it anymore
I'm not going to give it a paint job either because otherwise I'll just mess the paint job up
A large part of my life changed
It changed out of the blue
And then that's precipitating more changes
But a sort of synthesis of what I've been living with
And where I'm moving to now
Which is a place that I'm much happier in
Than when I think back when I'd been working for a long period
As a sort of salaried employee
This feels really positive
And it's also really, as I started off this
Saying that looking for ways, creative ways to still do the things that I want to do
Well that's one of them, building a laptop stand
Another one is how do I keep making podcasts
Now am I going to get Alex Bott to record everything for me
No and never, I mean that would be ridiculous
I actually like doing this
I just sort of got caught down a what if rabbit hole
Which I was having too much fun with
So I just followed it through and I thought oh this will be fun to put on the episode
But the situation changing is
Forcing me to look at things that I knew I needed to sort of figure out a while ago
In terms of making this stuff easier
And what can AI do to help if anything
The answer to that is a bit
It's much, much more helpful on the research side
But it can't write like I speak
And I don't want it to
I don't really use it at all for composition
I only ever use it for research basically
So it's not taking over this job
But I like doing this
But how do I make it easier
Well there's all sorts of little bits and pieces
And things I can do in automations
I'm a technologist so
Automating things is relatively easy
And it's something that AI is good for
Where you can say got all these files I need to moving here
Changing in this way
Have a summary added to them and blah blah blah
I'll basically organize my digital files
And it will just do it all for me
Specifically for those interested I use warp terminal
Which has a built in AI feature
So you can tell it in plain English what you want it to do
And it just does it
It doesn't always do it properly
But it does ask you and tell you what it's doing
So if it's doing it horribly wrong
You can at least intervene
So I wouldn't recommend this for someone
Who wasn't already fairly well versed in
The Linux style command line interface
But for any of you that are
I can thoroughly recommend warp terminal
But yeah things like automation and stuff
And again you have to be quite creative here
I really struggle with off the shelf products
That do almost anything
Be they in the real world or on computers
Because I've got very specific needs
I know what I want and I know generally how I want it done
And I don't generally want to have to change my whole world
Or my whole approach to accommodate for a tool
That doesn't really quite do what I want
How I want to do it
Now sometimes you'll think out of something
That tries to force you to do that
And you realize no actually this is better
This is actually better than the way that I was going to do it
But more often than not I'm working the way that I want to work
Because that's how my brain works
And that's how I need to operate
And changing that is just going to be friction
And probably quite a lot of heartache
And so I tend, and this is why I learned to code and program in the first place
Is that I tend to want things done how I want them done
And so I have to be quite creative
And I have to come up with these solutions
And I can get the internet or AI to help me solutionize a bit
And to give me options and other ways to think about how to do it
But ultimately how am I going to get from A to B
I'm going to get there the way that I want to get there
How do I make that easier
How do I make it faster
How do I make it more efficient
And that's a really creative exercise
And it's actually quite a lot of fun
And I don't really see it as different at all
From how do I take this image and turn it into a painting on canvas
How do I take this bit of wood and turn it into something beautiful
How do I take this pile of planks and fence posts
And turn them into a laptop stand
How do I automate the process of transcribing, summarizing and organizing
My recorded podcast stuff and my voice notes
Because I make a lot of voice notes
Because I prefer to think while walking
And so how do I deal with that
And it's all the same thing
It's all just a creative continuum
And I always look forward to doing this stuff
And I always have
One of the most formative moments of my younger life
Was when I first started
One of my earliest jobs in computing and IT
You may not know this
But I was one of the first 15 or 20 employees in the UK by Amazon
I actually worked for a small online book retail outlet called Book Pages
Which was I think the first if not one of the first purely UK e-commerce sites there was
And certainly I think we were the first book seller
And so when Amazon expanded from the US
The first territories they changed was UK and Germany
And in the UK rather than start from scratch they bought Book Pages
And I'd been working there for a few quid an hour packing books
Off a window seal in an office in Gerald's Cross in Buckinghamshire
Just because I didn't know what else to do
My mate was working there and he got me a job
I was bought by Amazon at that point and I was in the dot com boom
At the point I joined Book Pages I didn't know what an email was
I'd never sent one and within a couple of years I was doing large scale infrastructure builds
For warehouses and offices, IT infrastructure, cabling, support, operating systems, all this stuff
It was crazy, it was absolutely bonkers
This was before Amazon were evil
And I actually did meet Jeff Bezos briefly for my sins
Anyway, at one point I was working under a what you would call Unix or Linux admin
Like a hardcore server techie
And he taught me one of the most important lessons of my life
Which was essentially what he characterized as the lazy school of Unix admin
Which was if you don't want to do it automate it
If you've got to do it, say more than twice, automate it
Just build a script
In those days it was Perl but in those days it might be Python or something
And you just make it go away
You write a script that will do that thing and then you schedule it
And then you go and do something else
And I was like well what else are you going to do
He goes well whatever you want
I was like well what?
I don't know, just go down to pub or something, whatever
And I was like really?
Well no, you might do but what you're probably going to do is go and find something else more interesting to do
And it's basically like well what my job is is to do myself out of a job
But then I was like well then you'll be out of a job
And he goes no I won't because I'll go and find more important things to do
And he really didn't care what his team did as long as the job got done
And so one of his people Rob would just sit there day trading
He would just sit there with a stock ticker in the corner of his screen
And automating stuff away so he could spend more time making money on the side
And it was just okay
And I'm not the sort of person that will use automation to slack off
And to be fair if you're the sort of person that thinks that way
Then you're not going to slack off
You're going to automate something and then move on to the next most interesting thing
And you do that a few times
You start to find a bit tiresome so you automate that
And you keep going
And this is a credo I've basically lived my life by ever since
Is that don't do it twice which really suits my ADHD brain
And learn to really love the process of making problems go away
And it's seen me into some really interesting places
And it's allowed me to really excel in lots of areas
And a lot of people just can't fathom it
It's like you've got to do a job
Or you've been paid to do that job so do it
Why though?
Why if I can make that job go away would I do it?
And I think that if more people understood that
The world would be a better place
But I think some people just seem to do what they're told
And I'm not very good at that
But we've been over that ground before
Anyway, this is me digressing very, very large amounts
But it all does fit together
This is all part of my life and my personality
The sort of lesson here is that you've got to hold on to hope
Because things will change
Something will happen that will give you a little chink of opportunity
To drive a wedge into and make into something bigger
So I'm already thinking about how I capitalise on this new contract
And what I can do to keep it running or to use it to springboard me into other
Work with a whole bunch more confidence
And that change came out of nowhere
I didn't even see it
It just turned up in my inbox
And so it's been a really interesting few weeks of discovery
And I'm not out of the woods yet
But it's a massive step in the right direction
I've got a lovely new ramshackle laptop stand
And a mini me, a mini AI me
And no doubt lots of other things
And I still spend every evening in my workshop
Making a mess and having fun with bits of wooden canvas and so on
And I will continue to do that
Because that's the thing that I need to keep me healthy and sane
And it's the thing that got me through this really dark period
And so I think maybe the message here is
Creativity is always important and it's always useful
And you can either use it purely on its own to make you feel better
Or you can use it to change things about your life
While doing them make you feel better
While making those changes, while creating your laptop stand
You feel good about it
And you're also helping other parts of your life as well
And I don't know, I feel a little bit mixed up with the message here
But this is what these episodes are for
For me to stand in front of a microphone
And sort of ramble about what's going on in my brain
And I think there's lots going on in my brain
There's so many things swirling around
And so many different ways of thinking about the change that's occurred
And what it means and where I go from here
That's probably coming out in the way that I'm talking
But I don't consider this a bad thing
Anyway, I just glanced up at my clock
And guess what, it's time to start work
How exciting
It really is, I'm recording this before 9 o'clock, it's about 10 to 9
And I will start work at 9
And I haven't even got changed out of my morning lounging clothes yet
Not that it matters since my job is working from home
But sitting in front on a call, should one arise in the dressing gown
Is not generally the best look
So I'm going to go and get changed and get back onto my day job
And I fully intend to keep this up weekly if I can
You'll forgive me if the frequency is either a little bit erratic
Or sometimes I have to skip a week
But I fully intend not to, I just can't absolutely be sure that I can
And hopefully I can keep the quality up
Because this really is important to me
And I hope that hearing about my experiences helps you a bit
And if you're having a hard time at the moment
Then just know that things get better
Things change, opportunities arise
They don't always come from where you think they're going to come from
But they will come and things will get better
And I hope that gives you some comfort
And I'm going to go and get ready for work
Bye
I'm going to go and get ready for work
