# Episode 25: Mind Your Language - Significant Quotes

## Opening Challenge Examples

### AI-Generated Art Speak
**Rothko Description (ChatGPT):**
> "The juxtaposition of the saturated hues, an eternal crimson just opposed against a sombre umber invites a dialectical engagement with the viewer's psyche invoking a liminal space that oscillates between the corporeal and the metaphysical. This chromatic dichotomy serves not only as a visual stimulus but as a conduit for existential contemplation, prompting an introspective traversal through the labyrinthine corridors of the subconscious."

**Bob Ross Description (ChatGPT):**
> "The compositional structure characterized by a harmonious juxtaposition of verdant shoes and cerulean skies evokes a sense of serene equilibrium yet it's precisely this equilibrium that invites a critical examination of the artist's intentionality. The brushstrokes while ostensibly gestural reveal a paradoxical tension between the immediacy of expression and the calculated precision of execution."

**Bob Ross Description (Google Gemini):**
> "The most aggressively and uniform application of pigment speaks to a deep seeded fear of the unpredictable, a desperate attempt to control the chaotic flux of the creative process. The resulting effect while superficially pleasing ultimately exposes a profound ontological insecurity, a yearning for a stable immutable reality that is of course fundamentally unattainable."

## Alex's Core Arguments

### The Problem Definition
> "So what does this tell us about how art is portrayed in the art world? One, it's usually impenetrable, pretentious gobbledygook that seems aimed at alienating the reader. Two, it's so ubiquitous and homogenous that two, and I assume any dumb AIs designed to regurgitate text stolen from the web can reproduce it convincingly and in basically the same language and even using basically the same words. Three, it can be used to describe any work in pseudo-academic terms that render its use meaningless. And four, it's called art speak and I hate it."

### Personal Impact
> "I very rarely read any of the accompanying text because I find it arduous to the point of physical pain. I've never really been good at reading. As a kid I really struggled and I didn't read a novel cover to cover until my early 20s. When presented with a field of text my brain just sort of seizes up."

> "So I like writing that's concise, clear, uncomplicated and meaningful. This is not a matter of taste, it's a matter of necessity."

> "So imagine what happens when I try and earnestly consume some art speak. Fuses start to blow immediately, it causes me something like physical pain. Not only is it overly redundant, convoluted, bloated and unintelligible, it also contains almost no useful information. It's a literary abomination."

## Real Art Speak Examples

### From Zhao Wuxi Book
> "His use of delicate colour treated often in terms of nuances and assonances rather than contrast together with the cobweb-like graphics that seem to irrigate the whole surface of the canvas. The split between drawing and colour which becomes increasingly subtle the more in the same work both elements alternatively predominate as if in a musical composition with a dominant tone at each moment provided thus a new solution to the eternal dilemma of content and form."

**Alex's Response:**
> "I can barely even say it let alone understand what it's waffling on about. That was from a book about the work of Chinese abstract painter Zhao Wuxi, one of the few abstract paintings I really love. I genuinely want to tear out these pages so I'm only left with the glorious pictures. Art speak is an abomination."

## Academic Validation

### Pascal Unberhorn's Five Observations
> "One, art speak sounds bloated and preposterous. Two, many texts strongly resemble each other. Three, they seem to be only loosely related to the artwork in question. Four, the contents appear incoherent and obscure. And five, texts feel like they might be auto generated by an algorithm."

### Harry Frankfurt on Bullshit
> "In his 2005 book On Bullshit American philosopher Harry Frankfurt argues that bullshit is a distinct phenomenon from lying. He postulates that while lying involves a deliberate attempt to deceive by stating something known to be false, bullshit is characterized by the lack of concern for the truth. Bullshit is not primarily interested in whether their statements are true or false rather that they are focused on creating an impression often of competence and authority."

### LLM Bullshit Theory
> "We draw a distinction between two sorts of bullshit which we call hard and soft bullshit where the former requires an active attempt to deceive the reader or the listener as to the nature of the enterprise and the latter only requires a lack of concern for the truth. We argue that at minimum the outputs of LLMs like chat GPT are soft bullshit."

## ChatGPT's Five-Year-Old Explanation
> "Imagine you're playing with Lego and you build a really cool spaceship but instead of saying I built a spaceship you say something like my construction utilizes the interdimensional spatial vectors to explore the deconstruction of traditional aeronautical paradigms which I think pretty much encapsulates it. Using convoluted overly intellectualised language to describe something seeming to say something profound but failing to really say anything at all."

## Tolstoy's Wisdom

### On Art and Interpretation
> "The artist, if a real artist, has by his work transmitted to others a feeling he experienced. What is there then to explain? If the work be good as art then the feeling expressed by the artist, be it moral or immoral, transmits itself to other people. If he transmitted to others then they feel it and all interpretations are superfluous. If the work does not infect people, no explanation can make it contagious."

> "An artist's work cannot be interpreted. Had it been possible to explain in words what he wished to convey, the artist would have expressed himself in words. He expressed it by his art only because the feeling and experience could not otherwise be transmitted. The interpretation of works of art by words only indicates that the interpreter is himself incapable of feeling the infection of art."

### On Art's Professionalization
> "As soon as art became not art for the whole people but for the rich class it became a profession. As soon as it became a profession methods were devised to teach it. People who chose this profession of art began to learn these methods and thus professional schools sprang up. Classes of rhetoric or literature in the public schools, academies for painting, conservatoires for music, schools for dramatic art. In these schools art is taught but art is the transmission to others of a special feeling experienced by the artist. How can this be taught in schools?"

## Alex's Analysis of Gatekeeping

### The Strategic Function
> "But that's precisely the point isn't it? The Hoi-Poloi are supposed to feel alienated and patronised by such texts. It's a thinly veiled strategy to gatekeep by using faux intellectualism. This keeps the art fraternity exclusive and gives wealthy art buyers something to feel clever about at dinner parties. In short, it really has nothing to do with art at all. It's a parasitic cultural meme that perpetuates itself by taking over the mind of those exposed to it and turns them into eloquent sounding drones."

### Impact on Creative People
> "What concerns me is how this type of language leads truly creative people to feel that they have no place in the artistic community. To think that you need to have been to art school to create wonderful things. You might worry that if everyone thinks and speaks like this that you'll be ridiculed if you show your art to anyone who professes to know what they're talking about."

> "You might convince yourself that this mindless babble actually represents what art is and how artists think. You might conclude that you need to make works that can be spoken of with such words. You might decide just not to bother at all. None of this is the case."

### Mental Health Mission
> "As you might have noticed I take the broadest possible interpretation of what constitutes art and creativity due to my conviction that the production and consumption of art is vital to a functional society and one of the most effective means of managing mental health. My intention is to be as inclusive as possible."

## Authenticity and Identity

### The Essence Problem
> "As I said in my episode on identity in art you need to pour yourself the essence of you into your art for it to be fulfilling and for it to come across as authentic to the viewer. But how are you going to feel free to express yourself in the way that you need to if you feel compelled to describe it in terms that bear no meaningful relationship to it? How is writing a bunch of pretentious waffle going to make you seem more authentic? It's likely to do the opposite and all the while fueling imposter syndrome."

## Practical Advice

### Natural Communication
> "How then should you talk about your or anyone else's work? Well how do you talk about anything else? How do you talk about that simply incredible pizza you ate last night? How do you explain to someone why you thought the novel you just finished was so amazing? Simple, you find the words that come naturally to you and you use those. You try your best to match your word and phrase choice to the person that you're talking to."

### For Artists Under Pressure
> "Many artists do feel compelled or expected to produce this type of hollow prose when displaying their works. You may have little choice other than to do so in certain circumstances. In such cases do what you have to, but don't kid yourself that it in any way elevates your work. In reality the opposite may be true. Either way I can recommend not wasting your time carefully crafting such nonsense. Just get chatgbt or google Gemini to do it for you. As we've seen they're very good at it."

## Francis Bacon Addendum

### The Ultimate Art Speak Sentence
> "Behind the glass which according to him is a means of unifying material unevenness in the painting by which I suspect or by which I suspect is also intended to temper to some extent the realistic virulence of the works or perhaps to give a certain ceremonial dignity to the presentation of the character's court it would seem in more often than not in a warm tangle of erotic exchange or in the commonplace waking or sleeping attitudes not to mention the grossly functional ones or again to extend to the whole picture including the flat background and to finalize thanks to an almost literally englobing that process of setting apart of removal from the neutrality of everyday life which is achieved as regards to certain of its features by the most diverse means Bacon's canvases at once so effervescent and so controlled provide for the spectator who looks at them as a whole and grasp them in their diversity as a striking image of this unique contemporary artist in all his complexity a complexity I had hoped markedly to reduce by studying him in the mirror of his work"

**Alex's Reaction:**
> "oh my god that was one sentence please god help me"
