Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. This is first of what I'm calling my talking therapy
sessions where I interview someone about their experiences within creativity and mental health.
I'm incredibly honored to have a good friend of mine Sharon Milton who agrees to do an interview
with me. I think you'll find that her story is not only incredibly interesting but hugely inspiring
as well. She conquered cancer, she conquered the army, she conquered the police, she conquered
the Arctic, she conquered guns and she conquered art. Her story is truly fascinating so I hope
you enjoy this as much as I did. Hopefully this will be the first of many interviews I do.
So let's get on with it. Here's me and Sharon. I'm here with Sharon Milton. I've known Sharon
for what? How long have we known each other? Less than a year actually. We met when Sharon
came to one of my art group meetings and revealed to me that she had some experience in project
management. I immediately jumped on this because I had a bunch of exhibitions to arrange and I'm
terrible at organizing so I thought this would be really handy. She was very coy at the time about
just how experienced she is and I'll come back to that. Some point later took the lead on arranging
our big show for the Perthshire Open Studios event which was nine days of an exhibition
in the glorious Octorider Picture House that saw hundreds of people come through the door and
had a ridiculously well-attended champagne reception on the first evening.
So that went like clockwork thanks to Sharon's history in doing this sort of thing. So I'm not
going to say any more. I'm going to hand over to Sharon to introduce herself and we'll see how we
get on. Over to you. Yeah thanks Alex. So by way of introduction I would usually tell people that
I'm a retiree who spends time doing art and that's the short version. In my previous life
up until two years ago I was a police officer, also a mother of two sons and I live with my partner
in Octorider and it's only really been in the last two years since I retired that I've been
able to immerse myself fully in art focusing mainly on watercolours and laterally pastels.
So I would like to to call myself now and describe myself as an artist. My journey with
art has really been threefold. Largely for the first 50 years of my life it was about escapism,
escapism from the pressures of teenage years, anxiety connected with home whether that's
issues with my parents or living in an unhappy marriage, escaping the pressures of work. I'll
maybe come back to that shortly. And then nine years ago I was diagnosed with stage three cancer
and the art became very much a journey of rehabilitation and recovery for me and since
I've retired I would say my art is best summarised as prehabilitation. It's something I do
as a matter of routine. I enjoy it and the focus for me now is on staying well. So it'd be good to
go back to the beginning a bit and drill down on some of those issues you've raised. So if we go
back to your childhood and when you first started art and how it helped you. I mean I think like
many people I went to school and art was something that was a bit of an add-on, filled an hour or
two. I can't really remember the art classes I had at school which is a bit disappointing because
that that was the only form or tuition I ever received. I did ograde art, I remember enjoying
the classes because they were slightly easier than some of the more scientific subjects. But
in terms of key moments for me, my parents separated when I was 13 which was quite a
challenging time and I do recall spending hours and hours on my artwork which was
quite unusual for me. And when I look back now it's only on hindsight that I realise actually
that was purely escapism for me and I wouldn't have used these terms at the time but
you know a form of meditation as well, a means of coping. I did art until I was 16 and then went
down a science path. The timetable clashed so I couldn't take art into my sixth year and I pretty
much parked art until I was at university and there was a lot going on at home. My mother was
an alcoholic and that bought with it a lot of turmoil and upset and she slowly drank herself
to death over about three years. And during that time I focused a lot on pencil drawing and some
of the pencil drawing I did, very very detailed, took hours and hours and hours and again it's
very clear to me now that that was about escapism. But other mediums I didn't didn't explore any
other form of art other than pencil drawing because it was easy. You know HB pencil, 2B pencil
and a sheet of paper, fairly easy to you know do art wherever I was. And then roll the clock forward
I graduated from university, I joined the police and loved it. You know I was in an environment
where I fitted in. I at risk of signed an arrogant was a good police officer, a successful police
officer and although I was good for the police it was only later that I realised the police
wasn't necessarily good for me. So the pressures and the stress although it was exhilarating,
thrilling, fantastic challenges, great people, it did take its toll in terms of stress.
Where were you at the time when you joined the police? I joined the police after graduating from
Aberdeen University and my mother died just before I graduated and I took the decision
to join Avon and Somerset police in Bristol to be near my brother and sister and about a year after
joining the police in Avon and Somerset my ego had to accept that my brother and sister would cope
fine without me and actually I saw less of them when I lived 40 miles away than I did when I
lived in Aberdeen. So love and my interests in outdoor pursuits bought me north again and in 1997
I transferred into Grampian police and then spent 25 years pursuing a really exciting career in the
police. So before we get into the police bit, were you living on a farm? I married a farmer and
lived on a farm and obviously bought my two sons up alongside that had a very challenging job. So
it took a bit of juggling but yes lived on a farm in the back of beyond up in Aberdeenshire.
Yeah they say that running a farm is like more than a full-time job. You were juggling two more
than full-time jobs and so did you find any time there for art and did that influence the experience
of living working on a farm influence that side of you at all? Not at all. I mean I was fortunate
that my husband at the time and his parents ran the farm so I had nothing to do with that. I kept
it fairly much at arm's length but had you know two young children as well and a very demanding
job that was taken up at least 60 sometimes 70 hours a week plus commuting. You had quite a
trajectory from you know the beginning of your career. I guess you were a street bobby at some
point. You weren't in the police office for 25 years. Does it feel like that was a fast progression
or is it just something you did over time just worked your way up? So my progression in the
police was quite unusual for police officers in that my first promotions came really fast and then
over time they slowed down. So the further through the police I went the longer it took to
get promoted which is not how things usually happen. Ordinarily someone does 10 years they
get promoted to sergeant do another six or seven get promoted to inspector and it gets quicker.
For me I did four years got promoted to sergeant three years got promoted to inspector and then
every rank after that was six or sort of seven years. So it didn't feel rapid but against the
sort of usual milestones it was. So do you want to give us the highlights then of the big things
that happened up until you retired? Okay so I joined Avon and Somerset place in 94 transferred
to Grampian in 97 worked my way through a number of ranks so everyone starts at the bottom PC
sergeant inspector chief inspector superintendent and in 2015 I got promoted to chief superintendent
which is where I spent sort of the last seven years of my career. I'll come back to that because
that was absolutely the highlight of my career I just loved it that was brilliant and then 2015
was just a really pivotal year for me in every way. So December 2015 I got my promotion to chief
superintendent I was put in charge of a department that deals with emergency events and resilience
planning across Scotland with a team obviously spread right across Scotland and three weeks
later I got a cancer diagnosis stage three breast cancer. So literally I just started the job
hadn't even got my feet under the table and I take a year off work and that's probably where my
proper if you like journey with art started again so I'd had maybe 20 years where I'd not picked up
a pencil I'd not done it wasn't quite 20 years say 15 years where I'd not picked up a pencil
picked up a brush but I found myself facing a situation where I didn't know if I was going to
live and I don't say that lightly and receiving treatment that required me to stay away from
people and the art was something that I threw myself into. That was quite a challenging year
as you can imagine fortunately appeared to tell the tale and recovered. When I went back to work
a year later I was very much a changed person ultimately my marriage didn't survive the cancer
diagnosis either but when I went back to work you know had a real thirst for life a real enjoyment
of the role and probably the absolute highlight for me in my police career was the seven years
that I spent as a divisional commander in charge of the events emergency and resilience planning so
highlights for me were leading on the protective security for the climate conference COP26 in
November 21. That was in Glasgow? Yeah in Glasgow responsible for the protective security of 128
world leaders and nine members of the royal family just amazing absolutely amazing. I led
the planning and supported the delivery of the police and arrangements in Scotland for the
Queen's funeral and I wrote the police strategy which was subsequently adopted across the UK for
the response to the COVID pandemic so those were probably the three three main highlights in the
latter. Yeah nothing nothing big there. What a boring life you've led and you've met some world
leaders? I have so I've still got the screensaver it's number one photo on my phone of myself and
Barack Obama. I was invited to Cameron House during the climate change conference because
he wanted to thank me and my team for the efforts that we'd put in so that was absolutely a highlight
could only have been improved if his wife had been there because I would have liked to have met
Michelle too but no amazing. Life's full of disappointments hey? Is that anyone else you
met? There's so few people that I've met plenty of people that I've spoken to on on the phone but
I've probably got to wait another 25 years before I can display any of the details. Okay any names you
can give us? Well I mean when you're responsible for the security of 128 world leaders and
an event things do get interesting and policing is meant to be as far removed from politics as
it's possible to be but that certainly proved a little bit challenging. No he's staying tight
lips on some of the characters. I know about some of them and they're very interesting humans I can
tell you that. Let's bring this back to the art. How did you find time to do anything like after
your cancer diagnosis? Obviously going back to work and having like a seriously important job
were you able to find time? No is the answer so I could go a whole year where I didn't pick up a
paintbrush but conversely there would be some days that I'd come home from work and be brave and took
my coat off. I'd painted the same pictures 20 times and I now realize it was just absolutely
about coping and stress relief and it was about the process rather than the outcome. Again you
know I mentioned escapism earlier. During cancer my painting was very detailed. I did a lot of
botanical painting, produced calendars, sold prints for charity. It was very focused work
and it was absolutely about generating a product that I was proud of. I spent hours and hours
working on that but when I went back to work as I said I'd get home from work some days
and you know be cooking tea with one hand and painting version six of a picture with another
hand and watercolor has lent itself to that but literally during the year around about the climate
change conference I did not do any art at all. Partly because I didn't have a day off but I realize
now looking back that actually my sense of well-being and my mental health would have been
enhanced had I found the time to do that. And so you retired as you do quite early? Yeah I took
early retirement. I had 28 years service normally the police retire after 30 years service but I
promised myself and my partner that if I lived to 50 then I would retire at 50 and I stretched it
out to 51 because the excitement and the prospect of leading the climate change conference
and then laterally I returned I came out of retirement to deliver the Queen's funeral.
It was just too exciting an opportunity to miss but at 51 I did the decent thing and I retired
and I promised myself when I retired that I wouldn't look for a job for a year.
I'd given myself a year off and here I am two and a half years later and I've still not got a job
and I've managed to get bored once so I turned the TV on but otherwise I'm feeling well healthy
happy and just managing to eke out as much time to be creative as I would ever want and it's great.
Do you miss it the job? No I mean I've got so many highlights that I can reminisce about and
still get a buzz when I think about and in fact some of it is so bizarre that when I think about
it now it's like did that actually really happen and I'm sure in years to come if I have the gift
of grandchildren when I'm retelling the tales they'll think I've made them up but no I don't
miss it. I think the the stress levels and the pace was quite exceptional actually. So well yeah
so if they beckoned you back out of retirement again you're not going to say yes. Well joking
aside I don't think they would ever do that it was very difficult to manage I think I was well
I know I was good at my job and again that does sound arrogant I know I was good for policing
policing wasn't good for me the environment I didn't thrive in that environment but I've heard
from pretty much every manager I ever had that was really challenging to manage so I don't think
there's ever a prospect of me being asked back. It's always good to have someone around the place
that's going to cause a bit of trouble and shake things up and of course we're sort of sidestepping
the fact that you're not male as everyone might have noticed and the police is a very male
institution in this country but I suspect everywhere. How did you find that side of things?
Yeah I mean for me it was part of the challenge and for many years it was quite exciting by the
time I left you know 28 years into my service it started to actually get a little bit tedious
um so you know for for the first 20 odd years it was quite exciting being the pioneer in the first
woman to do this and the first woman to do that and the first divisional commander the first
firearms commander the first you know public order commander um you know and I was quite
proud of that but in 2022 you would sort of hope the environment that you're in
might have changed um and and unfortunately for most people it hadn't so frustrating
proud of what I had achieved um I tried to create an environment for other women to thrive in as well
I'm quite proud of what I did in that regard but no I'd had enough by the time I retired.
Yeah I can imagine uh and firearms commander oh yeah you shoot guns yeah so the firearms
commander is about authorizing the deployment of police officers with firearms obviously for the
climate change conference it was a large part of the event in terms of armed close protection and
and oh just great. Did you hold a gun and have you shot a gun? So I did but not in the police
so I've been in the I spent time in the territorial army so my my role in the police was much more
about sitting in an office and doing the checks and balances and authorizing other people to carry
guns. Yeah it was it was quite high pressure I have to say you know when you're when you're
dealing with matters of split second decisions as to whether police officers with guns can
you know apprehend someone or go into their home or you can imagine. I can honestly do a whole
episode just talking about that that's really really interesting but we won't because this is
an art podcast I've got one more thing I want to cover in case we forget is your um your skiing
thing. So when I was diagnosed with cancer and I had six weeks where I was waiting for various tests
that were going to tell me whether it was something that they could treat or cure so
it was basically the six weeks of waiting to hear how far it would spread and whether it was
terminal. A friend of mine in an effort to encourage me and keep me optimistic suggested
we sign up to an Arctic marathon in Sweden on cross-country skis and the truth is I thought
well I might be dead there's no harm signing up to this so I signed up to it and put the word out
started painting pictures and what happened is people started buying the pictures and prints
and cards as a form of sponsorship so two years later when I was almost finished the treatment
I found myself in Sweden having raised well between me and my friend £22,000 for the charity
Walk the Walk doing an Arctic marathon in I think the coldest it got was minus 36 which was pretty
cool um five days in Sweden and um yeah so that was the Arctic marathon. What a dull life you've
let um okay so let's bring this back to the art who are you as an artist at the moment? Well it
feels like a really exciting time for me because I spent 20 odd years just doing watercolours
and when I retired I treated myself and I went on a five-day art course which is the first time
I've had any tuition other than YouTube which I don't think you can understate the value of
YouTube um but I went on an art course last year and wow oh it was amazing absolutely amazing
so where I am now is experimenting with pastels working towards oils and I only say working
towards oils because it's about finding the space and acclimatising my partner to the amount of
mess and all the horrific smells that oil paints are going to generate in the house
but my inspiration at the moment is Scottish skies and we are really blessed living here
are just amazing and I'm I feel blessed because I'm not actually the one that goes out and takes
the photograph of the skies I've joined a number of Facebook pages about Scottish scenery highland
scenery we love beaches and I'm on them every day and there's just some amazing amazing
photographs which I save obviously contact the the people that have generated their mass for
their permission but I must have about 200 photos that I'm currently working my way through so not
short of inspiration it's primarily at the moment pastels which is completely new to me love the
vibrant colours and just so enjoy seeing seeing a picture come together we exhibited together
earlier this year you had your your wall of locks yeah tell us about those yeah so it was a set of
well ultimately I painted 19 rusty locks but by locks we mean the things that not blocks
as in Scottish locks but the things that are on doors like hinges yeah and I painted one which
was from a photograph that that somebody had posted and I really enjoyed the detail and the
colours and the textures it was watercolour so I started on an adventure of wandering the streets
taking photographs of people's rusty sheds and gates and ended up painting 19
rusty locks and I exhibited 14 of those as a set yeah actually I was quite quite proud of that
and it was a journey that just sort of progressed and evolved when I did number one I didn't plan
to paint 19 yeah I mean they're amazing I really loved them and so vibrant in colour
people sort of see decay like that and they think of it's almost dull right and that here's
something that should be thrown away you know tear that door that gate down and send it to the dump
and what you saw in that was beauty and vibrancy and colour and what would you think drew you to
well I think exactly just what you've said you know looking at rust and the colours and the
textures alongside shiny metal and alongside woods and you know just every single colour
that you could conceive was in a picture and alongside the happy accidents that you often
get with watercolour painting you're not quite sure what the paint's going to do and where it's
going to go there was the requirement for some precision and detail so it just was very different
for my usual style my usual style quite often loose washes but it just ticked to box for me
in terms of what my my brain and my soul needed at that time yeah I can really relate to that
and and you talk about you know this tension between sort of looseness of watercolour and
precision and detail and do you find that you sort of need that to to help you sort of focus in
and find that flow well I didn't until I retired so before I retired my work was very loose and
very quick you know it'd be right I've got 45 minutes in between a some report I'm reading
that I'm just gonna put colour wet in wet on a paper and see what it does it was just about
expression when I retired because I didn't have as much mental stimulation I found that my works
become more focused and more detailed so let's talk about art and mental health and and obviously
you know you seem in very good mental health at the moment you've had some huge challenges both
positive and negative and so what role do you think the art is played in getting you to where
you are today are you still here yeah so for me I think art's taken three forms to summarise
escapism what I would term is rehab and recovery and lastly pre-hab so the escapism you know for
many many years whether it was dealing with my parents separation my mother's alcoholism
bit of stress in work being in a very controlling and unhappy marriage art was a form of escaping
from that how does that manifest are you really not thinking about anything or is it that it
calms your thoughts down or it would certainly calm my thoughts down but when I'm in that zone
frequently it would be painting the same picture again and again and again and I thought it was
about you know striving for perfectionism but when I look back now it wasn't about that at all
it was about needing the process the therapy of this repetitive process almost like a mantra
and how people meditate and calm down actually the art was like that for me but I would go years
where I didn't do it and then I would be compulsive over three days where the world would pass me
bias I was so immersed in the art so that was the escapism kind of art for me and that was largely
what art provided for certainly the first you know 45 years of my life. The next stage is what
I'll loosely term rehab so it's during the cancer rehab recovery and it was about capturing the
beauty in the world and I was looking at the world through a very different lens when I was
living with cancer in terms of you know every sunset was like looking at the last sunset every
daffodil was like the only daffodil in the whole world so it gave me a perspective where I really
saw beauty in absolutely everything which you know was quite poignant and for me that period of my
art was about capturing in absolute detail and with precision that beauty and it felt very
spiritual actually so you know the sort of rehab recovery is more about where I was in my life at
the time but the trying as an artist to capture probably the realism but also the mood and that's
more so I suppose in watercolour washes that are quite loose. So you sort of touched on meditation
and I think meditation and mindfulness are sort of two sides of the same coin
and from your description there it sounds like your observation of the world in terms of creating
artworks was a form of mindfulness. Yeah I mean and I've done you know the various courses in
mindfulness and meditation actually the regimes that I follow but there is absolutely a similarity
you know of that you know sitting down and looking at a leaf for half an hour and really
observing it and really seeing the colours and realising actually it's not just green
and for me it was a bit of an epiphany. Do you consider yourself a spiritual person?
Yeah I wouldn't say I'm religious I don't follow any religion. What I do find and you mentioned
earlier about getting into the zone or the flow I think is the term you use. For me when I'm in
the flow with my art I do feel like I'm being touched by something spiritual. Amazing and so
do you think that experience your cancer diagnosis sort of towing the volume up on the world to number
11? Thinking every day could be your last or among your last. Has that stayed with you all the way
through? I try to hold on to it because I think it's important but I would be lying if I said I
remember that every single day. Most of the time I think I do you know I take the dog for a walk
and I see the beauty around me and I consider myself blessed and I try to approach every day
like it's the last because I think it's a good philosophy and it makes me appreciate people and
things you know gives gives me gratitude but I don't always manage it. Yes life keeps getting
in the way of being calm and mindful. I guess this being a podcast partially about mental health or
mental illness and there's an element particularly in my life is using art to help in exactly say
recovery rehab. If this is of any use to people it should be for preventing relapse. And that's the
really important bit for me this is stage three and I term it prehabilitation. Many stories of
people like myself you know use art to escape the realities of life use art as a means of therapy
to recover or to treat illness. I'm in the zone at the moment where I'm focused on the pre-hab
let's do things to keep myself well. So rather than for many years you know art was the thing
I went to at point of crisis now it's the thing that I try to do every day as part of my daily
routine it might just be five minutes of you know shifting one past or across a paper and
then I put it down for the next day but it's looking at it as part of a pre-hab program
rather than a rehab program. And how do you think that works? Why do you think that works?
Well I think for me it's having the discipline and the opportunity now because I'm not working
but carving out the time. What also helps is having a space doesn't need to be a whole room
might just be the end of the kitchen table where things are there and to hand that if I
just suddenly get the urge even if it's only you know two minutes that I can express myself
through through art without requiring half an hour of setting setting stuff up and half an
hour of clearing things away. And so what is that your studio's next door to where we are now we're
in the kitchen so is that a dedicated studio? No an interest and it started off a gym and for five
years it was a gym and I think I went in there twice so I decided actually let's get rid of
the gym equipment and put some art stuff in there and chances are I'll go in there more than twice
so it's not a dedicated studio but we're gradually getting there. Yes indeed you're moving in
obviously I think you and me the same is that I would do my art whether anyone saw it or not
but I keep accumulating artworks and I have to A get rid of them to clear space and B I think
people like them and I could really do with selling more but I do sell the odd one and
the money is very appreciated given I'm currently unemployed. We've exhibited together
have you much history in exhibiting your work and what do you get out of it?
Good question the first exhibition I did was with you and the last exhibition I did was with you
so I haven't done much exhibiting I do use Facebook as a medium mainly because you get
pretty instant feedback as to whether someone likes things or not so it gives me a sense but
I don't always paint what's popular I think that's you know really important I paint what
I need to paint. I try to avoid commissions I've done quite a few now probably over the years about
oh I don't know 20 or 30 but I find it quite stressful. What I try to do is paint the picture
and if someone else likes it and wants to buy it that's great and that's sort of the zone that I'm
trying to preserve but I will paint the occasional picture for friends that ask me.
And what do you get out of that? Well a couple of things what I have done for years because I was
in employment and I didn't want to start having to fill out tax returns I would any pictures I
sold I would give the money to charity so I got a great sense of you know self-gratification and
just felt good to do stuff for a good cause so that was quite positive but aside from that kind
of altruistic side there's definitely something about ego you know my ego loves it when someone
wants to put one of my pictures up on their wall so it's not all about giving for others and there
is definitely that bit about seeing a finished work and knowing that someone values it and
appreciates it and wants to look at it every day is just amazing. Yeah it really is and what's your
partner think about it? So she is she's not very arty which is quite good so we don't sort of
compete with each other in any way and occasionally when I paint a picture she'll tell me I'm not
selling it because it's going on the wall so that's quite good feedback as well yeah she just
gives me my space to do what I need to do and periodically will tell me she likes a picture
she's never yet once said oh actually I don't like that which is quite kind because there's many
pictures I paint that do end up in the bin but she's not the one that tells me to put them in
the bin so no supportive is probably the best way. It's interesting really because our actual
trajectories are quite similar we started young disappeared for a couple of decades then took it
back up again as a form of therapy and so on and our perspectives are quite similar so it's really
really interesting to hear. Do you have anything else you want to want to say to the listeners?
A lot of people say oh well I just don't get the inspiration and I'm waiting for my
muse you know and I think you've got to start somewhere so just pick up a pencil and see where
it goes rather than wait for you know some divine hand to come down and strike you with inspiration.
Yeah I mean the inspiration comes after the perspiration and then before it and then after
it and then before it it's just a process right and I think a lot of people miss the fact that
it's not about this nice picture that you've made that's a happy accident almost that
comes at the end of a process that is the bit that we really value and I think you've just
got to get going you've just got to do something it might not be something you end up doing or
want to do but anyone can you know I mean and so I think that would be the summary for me you know
art isn't about the outcome it's about the process yeah absolutely and if this podcast is about
anything that that's exactly it so I'm going to wrap it up there thank you for your time
I'll let you get back into your studio and paint some more Scottish skies maybe I'll
have you back on again at some point but in the meantime thanks for joining me
