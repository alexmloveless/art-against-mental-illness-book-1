## Key Thematic Quotes

### Art's Three-Phase Journey
> "My journey with art has really been threefold. Largely for the first 50 years of my life it was about escapism... and then nine years ago I was diagnosed with stage three cancer and the art became very much a journey of rehabilitation and recovery for me and since I've retired I would say my art is best summarised as prehabilitation." [Lines 49-55]

### Art as Escapism and Meditation
> "I do recall spending hours and hours on my artwork which was quite unusual for me. And when I look back now it's only on hindsight that I realise actually that was purely escapism for me and I wouldn't have used these terms at the time but you know a form of meditation as well, a means of coping." [Lines 63-66]

### Process Over Product
> "I'd painted the same pictures 20 times and I now realize it was just absolutely about coping and stress relief and it was about the process rather than the outcome." [Lines 147-150]

### Prehabilitation vs. Rehabilitation
> "I'm in the zone at the moment where I'm focused on the pre-hab let's do things to keep myself well. So rather than for many years you know art was the thing I went to at point of crisis now it's the thing that I try to do every day as part of my daily routine." [Lines 301-304]

### Cancer and Art Return
> "I found myself facing a situation where I didn't know if I was going to live and I don't say that lightly and receiving treatment that required me to stay away from people and the art was something that I threw myself into." [Lines 118-121]

### Creative Autonomy
> "I don't always paint what's popular I think that's you know really important I paint what I need to paint. I try to avoid commissions I've done quite a few now probably over the years... but I find it quite stressful." [Lines 325-327]

### Getting Started Advice
> "A lot of people say oh well I just don't get the inspiration and I'm waiting for my muse you know and I think you've got to start somewhere so just pick up a pencil and see where it goes rather than wait for you know some divine hand to come down and strike you with inspiration." [Lines 348-351]

### Major Responsibilities
> "responsible for the protective security of 128 world leaders and nine members of the royal family just amazing absolutely amazing. I led the planning and supported the delivery of the police and arrangements in Scotland for the Queen's funeral and I wrote the police strategy which was subsequently adopted across the UK for the response to the COVID pandemic." [Lines 127-132]

### Life Changes After Cancer
> "When I went back to work a year later I was very much a changed person ultimately my marriage didn't survive the cancer diagnosis either but when I went back to work you know had a real thirst for life a real enjoyment of the role." [Lines 121-124]

### Having a Space
> "What also helps is having a space doesn't need to be a whole room might just be the end of the kitchen table where things are there and to hand that if I just suddenly get the urge even if it's only you know two minutes that I can express myself through through art without requiring half an hour of setting setting stuff up and half an hour of clearing things away." [Lines 308-312]

## Personal Insights Quotes

### Ego and Validation
> "there's definitely something about ego you know my ego loves it when someone wants to put one of my pictures up on their wall so it's not all about giving for others and there is definitely that bit about seeing a finished work and knowing that someone values it and appreciates it and wants to look at it every day is just amazing." [Lines 334-337]

### Supportive Partnership
> "So she is she's not very arty which is quite good so we don't sort of compete with each other in any way and occasionally when I paint a picture she'll tell me I'm not selling it because it's going on the wall so that's quite good feedback as well." [Lines 338-341]

### Charitable Approach
