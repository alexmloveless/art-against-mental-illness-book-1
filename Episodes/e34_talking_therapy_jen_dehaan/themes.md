# Episode 34: Talking Therapy with Jen DeHaan - Key Themes

## Core Themes for Book Development

### 1. Neurodivergent Creativity and Structure
**Theme**: The dual need for novelty and structure in neurodivergent creative practice
- ADHD brains seeking novelty through improvisation and new creative challenges
- Autistic need for rules, guardrails, and predictable structure within creative chaos
- How improv satisfies both needs simultaneously through structured spontaneity
- Parallel with Alex's art practice: multiple simultaneous projects (novelty) within routine studio practice (structure)

### 2. Performance as Controlled Social Environment
**Theme**: Using performance to manage social anxiety and "being perceived" discomfort
- Structured performance providing clear social expectations vs. unstructured social situations
- Knowing audience wants and expectations creating comfort zone
- Masking as daily performance preparation for intentional performance
- Performance giving permission to express authentic self through character

### 3. Art as Voice Without Direct Expression
**Theme**: Creative work providing emotional expression without personal vulnerability
- Using characters, art, and creative personas to express feelings safely
- Art allowing communication of difficult emotions without direct personal statement

### 4. Therapeutic vs. Therapy Distinction
**Theme**: Creative practices being therapeutic without being therapy
