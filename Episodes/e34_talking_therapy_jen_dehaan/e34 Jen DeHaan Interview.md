*   The interview is with Jen DeHaan, who lives on Vancouver Island, Canada.
*   Jen has a background in visual arts, digital art, tech (graphic design, video, audio), sewing, performance (dance fitness, vaudeville), comedy, and improv.
*   Jen's current focus is merging tech, performance, comedy, and writing.
*   Jen describes improv comedy, differentiating between short form (games like "Whose Line Is It Anyway?") and long form (scenic, story-based improv).
*   Improv involves active listening, building on offers from scene partners, and creating scenes or stories together.
*   Jen does improv digitally due to caregiving responsibilities, using podcasts and web videos.
*   Improv sessions often start with a suggestion that inspires a scene, involving an initiation and building a base reality.
*   Scenes typically last a few minutes, and shows can range from 20 minutes to an hour.
*   Jen discusses the cognitive load of improv and how it becomes more automated with practice, similar to driving a car.
*   Both Jen and the interviewer are ADHD and discuss how improv and other creative pursuits can satisfy both the need for novelty and the desire for structure.
*   Jen describes the concept of being uncomfortable being perceived, especially in social situations, and how performance can provide a controlled environment.
*   Different improv styles attract different types of people, with those who like structure often gravitating towards more rule-based forms.
*   Jen discusses how art and creativity have helped her manage dysthymia (low-level depression) and provide a voice without needing to directly express personal feelings.
*   Jen's current podcast project combines scripted and improv elements and focuses on mental health.
*   Jen notes that while improv is not therapy, it can be therapeutic by helping process feelings.
*   Jen is a caregiver for her mother, who lives nearby.
*   Jen recommends trying improv, emphasizing that it can bring joy and balance, even though it can be challenging to start.
*   Jen discusses alexithymia and how it affects her approach to improv, finding ways to work around the difficulty of labeling emotions.
*   Jen feels that performance has brought out something that was naturally there underneath.
*   Jen discusses her podcast empire and other projects.


# Jen DeHaan Interview

**Alex:** [00:00:00] Can't we with these things?

**Jen:** We are yeah, this one's pretty new

**Alex:** Yeah, Um, let me just find my notes and, uh, so we should be recording. Uh, don't, um, uh, so Descript will upload, uh, it sometimes takes a little bit to upload it when it's got to the end. Cause it needs to upload

**Jen:** right

**Alex:** uh, audio from both sides. when I start recording, just hang back for a minute, uh, we can just chat for a second.

Just make sure it's, um, It's, it's uploaded everything because if you shut the browser down, I think if either of us shuts the browser down, it won't be able to upload it.

**Jen:** Right, yeah

**Alex:** Right. Right. Let me just remind myself what I was going to say. Right. Okay. Hello, everyone. Welcome back. I'm here [00:01:00] today with Jen. we, uh, met by. I'm going to stop there. We met when I put a call out on blue sky. This is the first time, uh, we've actually spoken to each other, but Jim kindly responded and agreed to do an interview. And so here we are. Uh, so you're about to find out about Jen at the same time as me. and since, uh, this episode is going to focus somewhat at least on, on improv. Pretty, um, know, representative. Um, and so I'm going to hand over to Jen to, uh, tell us a little bit about herself. Um, Jen, over to you. Nice to meet

**Jen:** Thank you so much. Nice to meet you. Oh, thank you so much, Alex. So nice to meet you. I'm glad we connected on blue sky. Uh so my name is gender Han. I am located in Canada. I live off the West Coast on Vancouver Island, which is a giant island. Um, and it's sort of it's where I grew up. Uh, as well, um, my artistic background is, um, [00:02:00] I, I actually started off in the arts.

I was drawing. I went to and got a BFA, um, in sort of adult education in the arts, but I was allowed to take anything. So I did a lot of painting, a lot of drawing, all that kind of thing. And then I went to Vancouver film school and did, uh, digital art. Cause I really got into, uh, using computers to do art in the nineties.

So I went to Vancouver film school, finished that up, ended up in tech and did. Graphic design, uh, video, audio, all that sort of thing. Um, basically the Adobe creative suite, I worked on it and worked on all those different products. Uh, left, got into sewing. I got into performance. I did, uh, dance fitness. Um, I did vaudeville.

Uh, so really got into the creative performance stuff and, um, I've continued that in a digital sense doing, uh, comedy and improv and that sort of thing, and, um, I'm right now I'm continuing to sort of merge all those things together. the tech stuff and the performance comedy stuff together and writing and so on.

And that's what I do now.[00:03:00] 

**Alex:** That's amazing. Uh, uh, so, um, so, so you're firstly, I have to note you're in a green green room right now.

**Jen:** Yes. Got the green screen.

**Alex:** you. not, I don't know if that's symbolic at all. Um, Uh,

**Jen:** I

**Alex:** we're in very different time zones at the moment. So I'm in Scotland in the UK. So GMT in your what was it?

Nine hours or something

**Jen:** think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

**Alex:** usually some of what I guess you would broadly describe me as a visual artist. I paint things, although I seem to be more into carving bits of wood. At the moment. Um, but, uh, so you, you, you come from a, well, you've done a bit of everything by the sound of it, but, uh, obviously visual, uh, sorry, the, uh, perform, I guess more generally performance art, but comedy improv, and [00:04:00] that's quite different.

So all the interviews I've done so far with. with visual artists. So I was really

**Jen:** Yeah.

**Alex:** to have someone on representing something different. And I didn't, I didn't have anything in mind for that. But improv was not anywhere near the front of my mind. Uh, so I was actually

**Jen:** It's not in the front of many people's minds.

**Alex:** Well, exactly.

So, uh, interesting. So what, why don't you tell us before we get, because I think we're going to talk quite, I'd like to drill down on some of the other things you've done, but I think I was really interested in the improv side. It sounds like that's sort of your, your main passion at the moment. Uh, but, but do you want to tell us what you mean by improv?

I mean, I know I've watched whose line is it anyway? Uh, and I know about improv from, you know, jazz improv and I improv on the guitar a bit and so on, but do you want to tell us what, what it is from, from your perspective?

**Jen:** Absolutely. So, um, improv, improv comedy. I mean, you can do it in a lot of different spaces. So whose line is a lot of people's my entry point to [00:05:00] improv. Um, I guess in the eighties, probably I started with the UK version. Um, and, uh, so that's one example of improv. It's a sort of improv games. It's, um, often referred to as short form.

Um, sort of another theater sports is another sort of form. format of that. So there's that short form game. Um, the style that I do is called long form. So it's more, uh, it can be serious, dramatic. It can be comedic. Um, and you're basically putting together a whole story, uh, as a collection of scenes. So it's a lot more, it's scenic in nature as opposed to game, uh, form.

So improv, you're just, you're sort of, you're, Obviously, you're improvising, you're speaking off the cuff, you're listening, active listening is a big part of it, you're listening to your scene partners, they're giving you what we call offers, they offer something and we build upon that offer, add to the story and make sort of a scene or a story together, uh, so it's a, it's [00:06:00] very much a team sport in a lot of aspects.

However, you can also do it on your own. I'm doing, I do a lot of, uh, solo improv, improv on my own, um, and that can be, uh, for Audio podcasts, um, it can be short web videos. So there's a lot of, um, a lot of flexibility in, in what improv can actually be sort of, and that's the creative art aspect that I guess I love about it.

**Alex:** Yeah, I love that. And I think I don't, I do a fair amount of sort of artwork that I don't well, I don't plan a lot of my artwork actually. And funnily enough, the way you talk about it, you know, I guess I'm improving. I certainly improv guitar because I can't, I just cannot be bothered to learn anything.

**Jen:** Yeah,

**Alex:** and start whittling away.

But so are you doing this in, in, in front of an audience?

**Jen:** uh, I'm not doing it on stage, live on stage, uh, right now I'm, I'm isolated. I'm, uh, [00:07:00] basically I have a parent that I care give for, so I don't really go out in big groups anymore because I'm sort of keeping them safe from, uh, from germs and all that kind of thing. So, uh, so I'm doing everything digitally, everything online, uh, at this time.

So podcasts, uh, web videos, that sort of thing.

**Alex:** And does that also involve, so you say you're doing things online with other people, yeah?

**Jen:** Yes. Yeah. That's where I started, uh, doing, um, my improv. I started doing stage performance prior to, uh, becoming a fully digital entity, I guess. Uh, but I started learning improv online with, uh, with groups of other people and we use zoom and we turn on and off our camera and that kind of thing. And, and I've sort of moved podcast sense.

So doing a lot of audio improv, which there's a, uh, quite a, uh, Significant history of that through shows like comedy. Bang bang is a, a large scale example of, um, podcast based improvisation.[00:08:00] 

**Alex:** I haven't heard of that, I would check it out. Um, and so how, how do you, uh, so, so when you start an improv session, I mean, how, how do you start, how do you, presumably some sort of direction, how does that

**Jen:** Yes. Yeah. So, um, improv, even though we're just sort of making it up as we go has a lot of, I guess, guardrails or rules associated with it. So when I started, I started off just going to free online jams, which is just where we. Get together. I started off doing the whose line is it anyways style of improv where we just do short games.

You can drop in You can have never done improv before uh, they'll teach you the game in the moment say these are these are the guidelines either rules of the game kind of like They do on whose line and you just go ahead and you try it out and you just see what happens. So that's, uh, that was my first point.

But then I, I really, I got into it. I really enjoyed it. So I wanted to learn how to do it. So I [00:09:00] started taking classes. There's classes you can take online where they step through and say, what is. Yes. And what is an offer? What do you do when someone offers you a thing? What do you do with it? Uh, and how do you add to a scene and what is a scene structure kind of like, and what's a game like, what's the, how do you figure out what the game is?

All those things you learn in improv schools. Um, so I went to improv school for a while. I learned. That and then you can drop into these, uh, jams. You can know a little bit more. You can start, uh, improvising with teams. We all know the sort of the same language, um, and you can start making sort of shows and, and stuff like that.

So that, um. That's one way you can just go into the jams, not know anything, kind of learn and play along, or you can learn sort of the structure and rules around it and do more basically.

**Alex:** Can you give me an example of a scenario that you would choose to start an [00:10:00] improv?

**Jen:** Sure, um, so there's a thing, there's an initiation. So, uh, when you're starting off a scene, and I'm talking more about the long form scenic form of improv, not sort of who's line, uh, but what, what you do at the beginning of the scene, is you, you take a suggestion. So somebody gives you a Douglas fir tree. I just looked out my window, Douglas fir tree, and then that will inspire you.

You'll, you don't have to make the scene about a Douglas fir tree, but that's going to be your inspiration for the scene. So what does that tree make you think of? Oh, that tree makes me think of living in the. Forest. Maybe I live in a bunker or something. So maybe the scene is set in a bunker inside the forest.

And so then you give an initiation to your scene partner. Um, and I, I'd be like, Oh, this, this bunker is, uh, you know, looking a little bit dirty or it could just be like, Oh, you know, Oh, it's a nice morning to drink a cup of coffee outside the bunker or whatever it is. You [00:11:00] know, you're just sort of initiated into the scene partner.

Um, so it might show them a bit how you got to that. That word that you're given and then they'll just sort of start adding to the scene and you build that initiation that initiation into what's called a base reality, you're sort of learning what the who the what and the where is and you're doing that at the top of the scene.

So you're just kind of forming that, that idea of a world, right? And then after you sort of know who you are, what you're doing, um. That kind of thing. What's your relationship maybe to each other? Maybe we're a brother and a sister, uh, outside our bunker early in the morning, whatever. And then you're gonna look for what's that kind of interesting part of the scene?

Has anything, what's coming up that's just kind of interesting about this scene? And that might Form into what's called the game of the scene. This is one type of improv that I do specifically There's many other types, but uh, we're finding out what can [00:12:00] we play with that will make it interesting to an audience So then we'll work together To make that game and do what's called heightening that game So then we're going to make that game more and more interesting hopefully more funny if we're doing our job, right and then we'll we'll get to the point of the scene, something big happens and then the scene will be done.

Um, or we'll continue on in another related scene and, and build it into a set of scenes that make a full sort of show or story.

**Alex:** And so how long does a show strike story go on for?

**Jen:** Um, each, a typical scene, there's many different forms, but the kind of that I've done the most of, a scene might be two or three minutes, sort of an average, they can go longer or even be really short, but sort of an average scene is about two and a half minutes. And you might have a collection of those.

Shows can range from 20 minutes to a full hour or even sometimes longer, but yeah, there's a range in there But [00:13:00] usually when you have a show you'll have an idea about how long is this show gonna be is it 20 minutes? Is it 45 and your form will probably? Adjust for that, whatever, whatever you've chosen.

**Alex:** That's amazing. Um. Yeah, it blows my mind that you can do this. Um, although I guess the while you're talking, I'm sort of thinking about it going, well, I guess I'm improvising right now. I'm like, so you,

**Jen:** You are. Yeah,

**Alex:** as we agreed before, when we were talking before this, I just wing it right at these interviews.

And, um, and so I am improvising. So I guess I, um, I guess I do understand. Uh,

**Jen:** yeah,

**Alex:** And I think one thing that I find with doing that, I'm, uh, and we'll talk a little about neurodiversity in a little while, but I'm ADHD, so I, um, don't do planning really,

**Jen:** yeah,

**Alex:** is one of the main reasons I turn up and wing these things because I can, and I don't like planning. [00:14:00] And, um, but it's quite a high cognitive load while you're doing it. Do you find that you find it quite exhausting because my guess is you, you have to be running high CPU for the whole time, right?

**Jen:** yeah. So that's, that's sort of the amazing thing I find about performance in general. So before improv, I was doing dance fitness. Um, which was a very similar cognitive feel when I made that connection of my, my brain, my CPU power feels the same as this thing. Cause I love dance, but teaching dance fitness, that was just my joy, my passion in life.

Um, when I made that connection that my brain was doing that sort of that cognitive load, that was the same, it was just sort of, it was. Um, it, it did a lot for me because what happens when you're learning these things when you're starting off and you're learning dance fitness, uh, instruction versus or improv or whatever it is that has that kind of [00:15:00] structure, those sort of rules around it is it, it is a lot, it's exhausting, you, you, you have to, you're thinking about things in like a rapid succession, however, that's wonderful because I'm ADHD autistic, um, and, and I loved it.

That feeling that rapid, rapid, rapid, like making decisions and stuff, but there's still the structure and the rules around it. Right? So you're learning how to do these things like, well, base reality. Okay. We're about here in the scene. It's a lot, it's heavy. It's, it's very stressful. Very like you, you get out of a class or anything and you're just like, I need to go take a nap.

Like that was a lot. But what happens is, is. you eventually get to the point and all these things where you're running on autopilot. So you've got all these rapid things coming in from you, either your scene partners on a stage and an improv scene or from the people taking your, your dance fitness class.

Cause you're watching all of them and trying to accommodate for that same kind of thing. Uh, they're like your scene partners in an improv [00:16:00] scene. If they're you're. Teaching them how to do dance fitness class or whatever and so you're taking all these things in it becomes autopilot, you know Okay, that's that I adjust immediately and your brain just has this sort of autopilot thing going on And you just know how to relax react by your gut So what happens eventually is you don't need to think about all those things anymore You're you'll just react naturally and all you have to think about is doing what you're doing, right?

Immediately in the moment and your brain will take care of a lot of that. So eventually you do get to the point in improv where you aren't in your head. That's sort of the phrase that we use. Are you in your head? And that's all that thinking. I don't want to be in my head. I want to let go. And eventually you do get to that point where you just, you let go and you just take things in and almost react from your gut.

Uh, and I, it's hard to explain.

**Alex:** well, it's like driving a car, right? When you first learned to

**Jen:** Yeah,

**Alex:** it's like I've got all these things. I've got a gear [00:17:00] stick on, you know, what are all these buttons? And, uh, and then like nowadays, I'm just like, you know, you just tune out. Don't you? I'm just, I didn't even

**Jen:** it do.

**Alex:** How did I get here? Um, so

**Jen:** I stop at the stop sign. No

**Alex:** yeah, exactly. Where did this hamburger come from? Um,

**Jen:** Exactly.

**Alex:** um, so the neurodiversity thing was really interesting the way you described this, uh, we're both ADHD, ADHD

**Jen:** Mm-hmm.

**Alex:** uh, and one of the reasons I sort of realized latterly that, uh, the type of art that I do, um, suits me is because, um, My ADHD brain needs novelty, and tend to cycle.

I'm not one of these people that spends ages on the same piece. I've always got five, six, seven things on the go at the same time, so I, I can always get, there's always new things to do. but, um, it, so it pleases my ADHD brain, but it pleases my autistic black brain because I go to my [00:18:00] studio at certain times, things where they're

**Jen:** Silence. Yes. Silence. Silence. Silence.

**Alex:** that, um, You know, the whole thing around improv is novelty. but you talk then a lot about the structure, and it really struck me, is it's like you were describing the same thing as me, is, uh, you do this because it preleases both parts of your brain. Yep.

**Jen:** Yes. Oh, it absolutely does. And, um, that, that sort of, I think that was a lot of the stress, uh, in dance fitness, uh, for example, when I started that, cause it is very, when you're on stage, you're, you're yelling in a microphone at people, you're getting that novelty all the time. You have people doing [00:19:00] unexpected stuff that you get to react to and it's wonderful.

But I realized, and I loved it. But I realized I'm so stressed out for a while like I and I didn't really understand that and what I was stressed out about was, was my potential lack of structure around the class itself, because I was teaching. We're all sort of independent. We make our classes ourselves.

So that those rules and that structure a lot of it for. outside of actually teaching the one hour that you teach can be chaotic until you structure it. And I, once I learned, I could have my structure and I could do what I needed to do in that stuff before class and kind of control that in a way. I had a very specific way at all my little, uh, satchels of stuff that I would take and I'd have boxes and the boxes needed to be the right way.

And I needed to set everything up in the same order and the same, like everything before class people would offer to help me. And I'm like, no, please don't. There's a way. [00:20:00] Right. And once I honored that and I said, well, if I do that, that way, that alleviates most of the stress. Most of my stress is outside of the actual teaching, not the teaching itself and recognize that's where it's coming from helped me immensely.

So, Even when you don't, you can do what you need, including improv. You're on a team, you're working with other people. Once you figure out where, where is this anxiety or stress or anything coming from, for most people, it's the actual performance. But for other people like myself, it's not the performance that's causing the stress.

It's the other stuff around the performance that's causing the stress. So sort of being very self aware of what you need to put in place to help with that, uh, can be very important. Whatever you're doing.

**Alex:** I couldn't agree more and it sounds a bit, um, paradoxical to some people, especially given that the general, um, I don't want to say cliche, but the general behavior that [00:21:00] people expect around autism is, is introversion.

**Jen:** Mm

**Alex:** Yeah, you know, I, I, I'm exhausted by people, but

**Jen:** hmm. Mm hmm.

**Alex:** very sociable and I'm quite

**Jen:** Yeah. Yeah,

**Alex:** in front of a large, a large audience and just You know, just bullshit around, you know, just to

**Jen:** exactly. Yeah.

**Alex:** a podcast because, you know, often I just get to monologue and no one interrupts me because it's, I'm in control of that environment. Right.

**Jen:** Exactly. Yeah.

**Alex:** But it's all the stuff around it. Like if I've got to go and do, um, uh, like a speech somewhere or something, what stressed me out was that no one gave me the proper directions to the, to the place I was supposed to be going. They didn't

**Jen:** Mm hmm.

**Alex:** wasn't what they told me it was going to be and blah, blah, blah. By the time I get there, I'm, I'm sort of a bit of a gibbering wreck. And then. You know, you push me out on stage and I'm [00:22:00] like, you know, Elvis Presley, and it's like people are like, what the hell is going on here?

**Jen:** What's going on? Yeah. Yeah.

**Alex:** Um, and that's it. And I think, so how do you sort of, how do you square that off? I didn't know this idea of, um. Yeah, just the dichotomy of all of this and the idea of performance and being the center of attention because I, and I listened to that episode about, um, on your podcast about neurodiversity and comedy. Um, what, what was it

**Jen:** Yeah, being perceived the concept. Yeah.

**Alex:** Yeah. Tell us. I mean, that for me was, was, was really, really, it was really validating.

**Jen:** Oh, I'm, I'm glad. Thank you. Yeah. Um, it's, it's a, it's such an unusual concept because it's, and I think possibly sort of related to what we've been speaking about might, might kind of [00:23:00] illustrate, uh, just this. Very sort of unusual concept of, of why, where we are feeling uncomfortable being perceived, but it was, um, I did, uh, uh, I participated in a, uh, vaudeville like, uh, performance where we did sort of sketches in 1920s style, uh, local community theater, but it was a fun, fun show, uh, large cast of 50, very chaotic.

And, um, Most people, at least it seemed in this performance, were very nervous about going out onto the stage to do, uh, their, their scenes, their sketches, and I was completely nervous prior to going on stage, but because of the, uh, social nature of it, we'd all be behind stage, you know, waiting to go out, and I'd be standing there, uh, silent, because I kind of need that silence control, I don't, Want any of the [00:24:00] social stuff the social was what was making me?

Absolutely feel the anxiety of talking small talking behind the stage Uh, and I just wanted to get out onto the stage to do like what you were saying That's where I was comfortable because there's the rule there's some structure in the chaos, I guess There's what we know how we're being perceived. We know we're being watched by the audience We know that we're going out there to perform.

We know what our job is Um, whereas behind the scene I don't know what my job is. I don't know what's expected of me on that social waiting. Everybody else is nervous to go out there. I'm anxious to get out there. Like I want to go out there and I think it's that it's that sort of we don't know what's expected of us.

We don't know how we're being interpreted by others. I'm standing there silent. I'm wondering, are they thinking something's wrong with me? Because a lot of times when I'm in a group and I'm quiet, people are like, are you okay? Do you need anything? I'm like, no, I'm fine. I'm just listening. [00:25:00] Like. Don't bring the attention on me.

That's making me anxious. Right? Like, so I think just knowing what to anticipate, knowing how we're going to control how we're being perceived, we know what the audience wants. That's comforting. And I think maybe that's sort of where that perception is a lot easier for us potentially than being perceived in sort of the chaotic social structures that we have to participate in sometimes.

**Alex:** I mean, if, if, if I'm up there monologuing, Jesus, if you give me any chance to, to monologue, I will come and ask me about one of my, you know, whatever my current special interest is. Uh, and you've, you're going to lose 20 minutes minimum. And it's like, well, you know, I do that to one person. I do it to a hundred people.

I don't really care. I

**Jen:** Yeah,

**Alex:** I'm sure if they're bored, they'll make it. pretty well known, but it's a captive audience. I'm like, when else do I get to just stand here and say whatever is on my mind? And you'd

**Jen:** yeah,

**Alex:** Yeah. I

**Jen:** yeah. And they, they want this.

**Alex:** Yeah.

**Jen:** They want this. [00:26:00] Oh,

**Alex:** Yeah.

**Jen:** it's the best feeling. Yeah.

**Alex:** uh, other, you know, people who are more just on, on the autism spectrum, just, just find that whole concept absolutely terrifying. And, um, so the idea of something like improv is anathema to a lot of people, I think. Um, do you find, I mean, do you get, do you get all sorts doing this?

I mean, is there, is there a, is there a type?

**Jen:** Um, I would say the types might organize themselves slightly by improv style. There's a bunch of different styles, ones that are less structured and ones that are more structured, uh, and also style of comedy. So I ended up being very attracted to the style of comedy that I. kind of grew up with. I loved what is called alt comedy.

Um, it's just [00:27:00] like kids in the hall. I'm Canadian kids in the hall would be an example of that. I grew up with that. I loved it, but there's all sorts of other, uh, shows that are sort of in that sort of alt comedy sense that's ended up. That was what I was watching, uh, a lot of, and that's what I liked doing when I was in art school getting my BFA, I put up sort of what one of the teachers called.

Performance art. Uh, I didn't say who I was and I put up all these posters. Jen needs a friend and put all these little things on that people could tear off. I'm lonely. I need a friend. And it's sort of blurring the lines of, of what's real, what's not like, that's the sort of sub. Like subversive comedy that kind of thing.

That's what I liked Anyways, that's where I sort of ended up in the improv sense And I think a lot of other people that like that sort of style of comedy I I find a lot of them in the type of improv that i'm doing a lot of what might be other neurodivergent people sort of attracted to this style. A lot of rules, uh, it's, [00:28:00] it's, uh, very structured in, in how you structure a scene, uh, for the improv style of this.

And I, so I think it, it sort of attracted people like me, but, uh, in improv in general, there's all sorts, there's extrovert. Absolutely. The most neurotypical type people improvising with, uh, you know, autistic ADHD me, right? Like, so it does attract a lot of types, but I'd say probably a slightly higher percentage of people who like structure at least, or like a kind of a lot of rules in their improv might be attracted to the style I did.

Yeah.

**Alex:** this around. So obviously there's, there's two, two halves to this, this podcast. There's a, there's the art and creativity side and there's the mental health side. Um, uh, and it's surprising the amount of people who, you know, the, the, the, The creative and artistic side is, is, [00:29:00] at least started out almost exclusively about managing mental health.

And, uh, you mentioned that you're a, you're a carer, and I can imagine that comes with some serious challenges. Um, and, uh, you know, I note from your, your bio that you've had a few challenges in the past. And so do you want to, you know, tell us a little about that and how you think that. You know, your, your, your art, artistic and creative sides has helped that.

**Jen:** Uh, I think it has a lot like I would, I would consider myself dysthymic. So like low level depression for a long period of time. And, um, I, I, from a very early age would lose myself in drawing. Um, it, you know, some of my earliest sort of, Memories of where it was helpful on a mental health standpoint, uh, we used to go on vacation to the Oregon coast and I would, uh, I would lock myself away in this room that we got in this [00:30:00] little sort of vacation rental type.

Place in front of a window with my Sony Walkman headphones on drawing, like, and that was just my idea of happiness alone, locked in a room drawing, looking out a window at the beach, right? Like, and, and that would calm me after this incredibly stressful drive to get there. Right? So I sort of associated drawing with, with calmness and mental health and benefits, um, from a very early age, which is probably why I ended up.

Going to art school because it was sort of what I knew. And I found a lot of other people doing the same. They would go find their corners alone with their headphones and, and doing their, their art or alone, you know, very people that, that liked to sort of roll solo, I guess, um, which is why I made the joking posters, Jen needs a friend, right, and put them around.

Uh, so I, I think from an early age it did, and that's probably why I ended up in the creativity. It also, I think, [00:31:00] um, for. Not feeling seen not feeling like I really have a voice and I'm very introverted outside of the performance side as well Very, you know insular private type person the creative stuff gives you a voice without Needing to say this is me.

This is Jen saying this Um, I can say it as a character, I can say it through the art and just anything that would kind of give me a voice without having to point at myself, this is what Jen thinks, which is why my podcast and stuff about it has been one of the most challenging things I've done to say, this is me talking as me, um, very difficult because I've always sort of hidden behind the art or the characters or stuff, which has given me a little bit of sense of peace and, and, um, being able to say something, um, But also I'd say like through that, one of the podcasts I'm writing right now is sort of a combination of scripted and improv is all about mental health.

That's, that's the whole theme of the show, uh, [00:32:00] hitting rock bottom, hitting depression, getting out of depression. And what sort of some of these things that you can try, but told sort of through comedy, uh, sort of a mix of comedy and, and, and not. Um, and that I think. Being able to give the art, giving you those creative outlets of sort of having a voice through the story, through the characters is very, it's helpful.

Um, I think,

**Alex:** Do you find that, you know, whatever, um, you know, is, is causing you that, that psychological friction? Yeah. Um. At any given point in time, when perhaps you're having a low, does it actually come out in recognizable ways? Or, you know, do you, do any of the themes come out when you're improvising or, you know, are you feeling angry about something that's happened? Does that, are you angry in the improv?

**Jen:** I think, I think you can through the character. Some of that [00:33:00] will show up. Uh, one of the phrases that we use quite often in the improv community is improv is not therapy. So improv can be therapeutic. Um, but we're not just, we're not using the scene for therapy. Like that's, that's the part we want to avoid, but we can absolutely.

Use the feelings that are, that are in there, I don't think we can really avoid them to a certain extent. If you are feeling this underlying anger, you might be sort of releasing a little of that through the character. So as long as we aren't, you know, going and, and you know, turning our scene partner into somebody, that rep is representative of someone in our actual lives.

As long as we're not really doing that and we're just sort of working with this overall. Sort of state that we're in that's not really damaging or harming the scene for others Then that might I think that's probably that's not I don't wouldn't really know how to avoid that too [00:34:00] much because that's honest.

It's real It's what's there?

**Alex:** Yeah, I, and I've said this a few times on this podcast that, um, you're, you're there all over your work, right?

**Jen:** Mm hmm. Yeah.

**Alex:** it. And, and, and even if you don't see um, that it's coming out and it's, it's, it's there, um, other people will, uh, and, uh, and I agree with you, I don't, I don't think you can stop it.

And I don't

**Jen:** Yeah.

**Alex:** Um,

**Jen:** Yeah.

**Alex:** I think, my guess is there's a lot of parallels between, you know, me being hyper focused in front of an easel, for example. Uh, and you doing some performance in that. One of the hallmarks is I'm not thinking about the things. Uh,

**Jen:** Yeah. Yeah

**Alex:** Um, and they're very mindful, but that doesn't mean to say they're not there. and, and I think, you know, I could, think, I think my work, you know, reads a lot like a [00:35:00] diary, if I put everything on a long line. Um, you know, I'd certainly be able to see a story there. Um, so

**Jen:** Yeah,

**Alex:** avoid that. Um,

**Jen:** I don't think you can either. It just comes out. It's, it's surprising. Like in the writing in this podcast series that I'm doing right now, it's like, oh, I could, I, it's not intentional, but then you read it back after you're kind of editing it. You're like, okay, yeah, I see some. I see some parallels to my own life here.

Yeah,

**Alex:** yeah, we, we write our own, we're heroes of our own story or the

**Jen:** yeah,

**Alex:** Um,

**Jen:** yeah. Oh, that too. Yeah.

**Alex:** yeah, sometimes, um, I, I think, uh, my future, I know that my future me, my future me hates me. now, right? At any

**Jen:** Oh, for sure.

**Alex:** Because

**Jen:** For sure.

**Alex:** asshole. You know what I mean?

**Jen:** Oh, oh, I absolutely know what you mean. It's just like, oh, why, why did you do that? Like that was, that was recommended. [00:36:00] Now we've got to deal with it today.

**Alex:** yeah, exactly. Right. Because I couldn't be asked to deal with it two days ago when it really needed to be done. Uh, I hate past me. He, he is my hero idea, the villain of my story. Um, so, um, and so you said you're a, you're a carer. What does that, I mean, Tell us as much or little about that as you like, but you know, that's clearly a big part of your life.

**Jen:** It is. Yeah. So I live, um, I live on a, uh, a property, uh, that has two houses on it. I'm very lucky. My mom lives in the other, in the other house. So, uh, help her out quite a bit with, um, with health, uh, just what she needs because her health is, is a concern. So, um, and we've. Had some, some stuff that's been going on.

So, uh, just help her, help her out, uh, on a, on a day to day basis with what she needs and, um, and it very, very lucky to be so close by, uh, that she lives basically 30 [00:37:00] feet from my back door. So

**Alex:** Good, good, so you get on well then.

**Jen:** yes. Yeah. Yeah. We're very, very lucky. Very lucky to, to get along and, and, uh, and just, we, I mean, we help each other out too, because it's, it's, uh, I basically get to go visit her at a different, at a different house. And it's quite nice to be able to walk out the door and go to somebody else's house so easily.

So,

**Alex:** Yes, and you've got a lot of space, uh, uh, there in Canada.

**Jen:** yeah, we do. Yeah, so, yeah, I'm lucky I'm on, uh, 10 acres of forested land. So get to walk around a forest a lot and have space from. You know that that's quiet, which is quite nice.

**Alex:** You find that, um, because I live in Scotland, I used to live in south east of England, which is one of the most densely populated

**Jen:** Yeah.

**Alex:** world, but certainly of the UK. And I moved up to [00:38:00] Scotland because there's far fewer people up here. And I have

**Jen:** Mm hmm.

**Alex:** and trees and stuff. And, uh, you know, once I, once I got here, I really, I didn't, thought, I sort of thought I needed some isolation.

I needed a break from being constantly surrounded by people. And once I got here, I think I realized just how much I needed that and, uh,

**Jen:** Yeah.

**Alex:** it's so easy to find places to shelter around here.

**Jen:** Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that was, um, I lived in cities for most of my adult life, uh, grew up sort of subdivision, but then moved out in my 20s. So I've spent about 20 years, San Francisco Bay area and a couple different spots there. Toronto, Calgary, et cetera, and always lived in townhouses or apartments, of course, as you do oftentimes in the cities.

And then, so this is the first time that I have ever lived in a single family dwelling, I guess, [00:39:00] have four walls around you without You know, adjoining neighbors and it's so quiet. And when I first moved out here, I was just, it almost scared me. And I, I mean, I loved it and I love it now, but it kind of, it was very unsettling not having so many voices around, but then I quickly got used to that and I love it.

So

**Alex:** Yeah, I

**Jen:** fortunate.

**Alex:** couldn't agree more. So, um, back to the, uh, the, the improv. So what do you, um, you know, would you, would you, you just, would you recommend anyone try this and what do you think the sort of the key benefits are it?

**Jen:** Oh, great question. Um, I, I absolutely, uh, I think it's worth trying. I think it's something that I never, I never thought I would enjoy performance. So my first performance was as a dance fitness instructor, you're going up on the stage with a microphone and stuff. It's similar in a lot of ways, like that way, the way your brain [00:40:00] works.

And when I started it, I, first of all, I kind of, Ended up doing it by accident, performing by accident. Uh, some friends invited me to go along and help them. Um, they didn't speak English was their second language and they wanted me to help them a bit with, uh, some of the, you know, translations and so on.

So I went to support them. Um, and I ended up a teacher at the end of it. So they're like, you should do this, you should do this, but it terrified me. It terrified me going up in front of a group. Um, I was, I was shaking, but then as soon as I got up there, it was just like this relief and comfort. And I was like, what, how did that happen?

Okay. And, and I kept going, but it's a struggle to start. It's hard for everybody, no matter what kind of neurotype you are, introvert, extrovert. I had one of my friends, uh, in that community was one of the most extroverted people, people, people, person, people. And she was just as anxious as I was, but in other ways, so for everybody, it's difficult as a huge, you know, it's a difficult thing to [00:41:00] start going up on stage and performing, but, um, it's has brought some of the greatest joy in my life doing it.

And it is mental health. It just helped balance me like nothing else. So it's worth trying. It's worth sort of giving it some time to get over that hump. It took me a few months to feel comfortable going in front of the group and teaching because it takes that long to kind of get things a little bit more automated.

So you're not. Completely in your head thinking. Um, but it's worth it because it can lead to something that you love. It might not. And then you can let it go and go try something else. But anything that you're learning is a hard new skill. You know, improv has the similarities. I, it took a long time for me to learn the rules and learn all those guardrails and have it become sort of more of an automated thing.

I'm not stressing and thinking about, and that automation, that's sort of the way that your brain operates when you can kind of let go and just have fun. It's [00:42:00] absolutely a balancing helpful thing. It gets rid of that stress. You get to escape from your thing. That's why, you know, hyper focus can be so wonderful.

It's kind of that same hyper focus feeling in a lot of ways. And that is a mentally balancing thing to have happen. You can also, of course, meet people, people that are kind of like minded, and that can be very helpful as well. Um, Yeah, and like, and like we are kind of maybe feeling some of those feelings that we need to feel to help sort of process things and even though it's not therapy, um, you're not treating it like therapy, it can be therapeutic in that nature of sort of helping you process some things.

Maybe after the scene you're going, Huh, maybe I should think about that thing a little bit more. Maybe something a little bit came up in the scene that you're like, Ah, maybe I need to process that. So, yeah, there's so many benefits. It's going to be different for everybody, sort of how it works out and what stresses you need to sort of resolve in the beginning, uh, to get over that hump.

**Alex:** I can, I can [00:43:00] really relate to that and, um, especially with the whole, um, alexithymia thing, uh, for

**Jen:** Hmm. Yes.

**Alex:** alexithymia is, um, I think, I think anyone can have it really, but it's, it's very common in autistic people where you can't, you don't. Recognize your own emotions. You don't either.

You don't recognize that they're happening. So,

**Jen:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Alex:** it. You might be really, really, really hungry and just not notice it. And then suddenly, bam, out of nowhere, like, well, how, why am I so stressed? Uh, how, how did I go from being perfectly fine to being Literally steam coming out the ears, and it took me years to recognize that this was going on with me and people. I was just surprised to everyone else when like Alex two minutes ago you were fine and now you are losing your shit. What the

**Jen:** Yeah.

**Alex:** And I'm like, I don't know. Um, and it was because I was stressed. I just hadn't noticed. [00:44:00] Um,

**Jen:** Oh my gosh. Yeah.

**Alex:** So I can

**Jen:** Yeah.

**Alex:** imagine it just comes out right and you know, maybe do you think it helped you? Um, label those emotions and so that after a while you sort of see it and you act it out and then it happens again, you know, IRL, um, you know, that you're like, Oh, that's what that one is. You know what I mean? Yeah. And help you

**Jen:** Yeah,

**Alex:** the emotions when they pop up.

**Jen:** I, I don't think it really helped me label them. And, and the reason I say that is we do have a lot of exercises in improv where a labeled emotion will be given to you. I also have alexithymia. Um, and so labeling those emotions, even well, after the fact, I couldn't do, I didn't really know why I couldn't do those exercises.

Um, I also didn't realize that I had alexithymia at all until I got into improv and had no idea what. Like, what is that really? Like how, [00:45:00] and I'd have to sort of jump back to previous memories that I had processed to kind of get an idea of how to even handle that in the scene. Um, but I figured out my own way to sort of handle that sort of thing and how to, how to, I don't need to label it.

I can just do a rough approximation and what that means to me, right? Like that will still work, but I haven't really. noticed being able to label them better. I think it's just, I've had to kind of shift how I do the improv to handle some of those things and recognizing it after, I think I'm still going more by the feeling than an actual word label.

Um, but there, even, even if you do have, it's completely, I just, I should say, you could still do improv, you just, you figure out your own way. And one of my favorite scenes was, I knew the other person in the scene quite well. I knew that they had alexithymia as well, and we were doing an emotion scene where we're each given the label.

And so I made some little comment just kind of knowing my scene partner and my scene [00:46:00] partner picked up on what I meant because it was the actual exercise and we made the whole scene about alexithymia without using the word alexithymia, but we knew what we were talking about and it gave me so much joy.

I felt so seen and we just laughed after the teachers like what's going on. I don't know what that's all about. But yeah, you can, you can still make these things work, but yeah. Yeah, I haven't really on the labeling thing. I don't think I've, I've noticed much of a, of a shift for me, unfortunately.

**Alex:** Nevermind, we'll get there in the end. Oh yeah. I love you.

That was you or me, but we're still here. Um, what I was about, what was I going to say? Right. So, um, so, so, but in general, do you feel like, uh, your experience, you know, through these various types of performance, do you think it's changed you or do you think that, you know, you've, you've just brought out [00:47:00] something was, was naturally there underneath?

[00:48:00] Yeah, I can imagine. I, I, I've been dancing around. Um, I haven't been dancing around. Two things I don't do. One is dancing and the other one is acting, right? So, um, uh, and I think the dancing one particularly, even if you go into a nightclub, no one's paying attention to anyone apart from, you know, people trying to hit on each other.

Um, and, uh, just. being seen dancing. I just feel like such a, like, so like one giant, like, embarrassment, like really worrying what people are going to think of me. So I have to be off my head, you know, drunk massively, at which point I can't dance at all. Um, so I don't dance. Uh, and I'm like, 50, so I don't go to nightclubs either.

Um, and I, there's a, there's a drama group locally I'm sort of peripherally involved with simply because they're part of the same wider arts group and they, they perform [00:49:00] next door, uh, to me. So I've been toying with, uh, joining them because and actually there's some of the stuff you've been saying. You know, I think I've always thought, well, I can't act right.

I'm so bad at it. And you know, the more I sort of think about it and hear what you've said, I'm like, well, actually, I don't, I don't know if I would be a good actor. Um, I think I can probably be a lot better. And I think I do a lot more than I think. And especially when you think about autism and masking.

You pinged out there again. Especially when I think about autism and masking. Well, I'm acting all the time, right? I have to act like a normal human being almost 24 hours a day. So I should be able to act like, you know, other types of human being. So maybe I should take up something.[00:50:00] 

Well, exactly. Well, and I guess the other reason why I wouldn't mind doing it is because, you know, I think it would be great for my podcasting. Um, and I'm finding my, I'm finding my feet with this stuff. And, [00:51:00] um, I feel like there's progression, but, uh, But I can imagine, you know, doing either improv or acting or anything would really sort of help me.

So I'm, uh, I'm super up for it. Uh, but I'm going to bring this to a close because what's going to happen is I'm just going to sit here getting advice from you for another hour and everyone else is going to switch off. So I should probably, I should probably not. And you probably try and charge me for it.

So, um, I won't do that. Um,

Uh, maybe we should maybe because I have so many questions, but, um, I, uh, I, we, we, we shouldn't. Um, so I'm going to draw this once we're close. Um, do you, so, um, firstly, uh, do you want to just tell us about your little podcast empire?[00:52:00] 

Okay. Uh, anywhere else we can find you or any, uh, what your plans, anything else you want to tell everyone about stuff you're doing coming up?

So I'll stick a link for stereo forest in the show notes [00:53:00] and basically go there to find anything else about you Amazing and it's a great website. Actually, it looks really good. But that's your other job, right making websites and stuff, right?

Yeah, I know I'm me too, but then I stopped doing it now. I seem to find my health I my life seems to be I'm a content creator, right? Who knew that's what I would end up doing but Why not god do something?

I know and it's quite daunting and then you do it and now you can't get enough of it. So I record any old crap these days and stick it on YouTube. Why not? Right Well, I maybe maybe we'll try this again at some point because I feel [00:54:00] like there's a ton of stuff we can drill down on here Maybe like you I'll have a little podcast senpai because I keep on coming.

I've got I'm starting another new podcast I was walking around today. I had another idea for a new podcast. It's literally like Alex. No, no No, you can't do more of these so

Yeah. Welcome to ADHD. Right. Um, but yeah, so I, it's been an absolute pleasure. Thank you for joining me. Um, and, and how good luck with the rest of your, uh, your, your improv adventures. And if I, uh, if I do any performance stuff myself, I'll, uh, I'll let you know. And maybe we can come at some point.

Amazing. Thank you. Bye. There we go. Stop recording.
