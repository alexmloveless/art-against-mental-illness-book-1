# Episode 34: Talking Therapy with Jen DeHaan - Significant Quotes

## On Improv Structure and Process

**Jen on the collaborative nature of improv:**
> "you're listening, active listening is a big part of it, you're listening to your scene partners, they're giving you what we call offers, they offer something and we build upon that offer, add to the story and make sort of a scene or a story together, uh, so it's a very much a team sport in a lot of aspects."

**Jen explaining scene construction:**
> "You'll, you don't have to make the scene about a Douglas fir tree, but that's going to be your inspiration for the scene. So what does that tree make you think of? Oh, that tree makes me think of living in the. Forest. Maybe I live in a bunker or something. So maybe the scene is set in a bunker inside the forest."

**Jen on the cognitive evolution in performance:**
> "what happens eventually is you don't need to think about all those things anymore You're you'll just react naturally and all you have to think about is doing what you're doing, right? Immediately in the moment and your brain will take care of a lot of that. So eventually you do get to the point in improv where you aren't in your head. That's sort of the phrase that we use. Are you in your head? And that's all that thinking. I don't want to be in my head. I want to let go."

## On Neurodiversity and Performance

**Alex's driving analogy:**
> "well, it's like driving a car, right? When you first learned to [drive] it's like I've got all these things. I've got a gear stick on, you know, what are all these buttons? And, uh, and then like nowadays, I'm just like, you know, you just tune out. Don't you? I'm just, I didn't even [think] How did I get here?"

**Jen on ADHD/autism balance in creative work:**
> "it absolutely does. And, um, that, that sort of, I think that was a lot of the stress, uh, in dance fitness, uh, for example, when I started that, cause it is very, when you're on stage, you're, you're yelling in a microphone at people, you're getting that novelty all the time. You have people doing unexpected stuff that you get to react to and it's wonderful."

**Alex on neurodivergent performance paradox:**
> "I, I, I'm exhausted by people, but [I'm] very sociable and I'm quite [comfortable] in front of a large, a large audience and just You know, just bullshit around, you know, just to [do] a podcast because, you know, often I just get to monologue and no one interrupts me because it's, I'm in control of that environment. Right."

## On Being Perceived and Performance Comfort

**Jen on the "uncomfortable being perceived" concept:**
> "Most people, at least it seemed in this performance, were very nervous about going out onto the stage to do, uh, their, their scenes, their sketches, and I was completely nervous prior to going on stage, but because of the, uh, social nature of it, we'd all be behind stage, you know, waiting to go out, and I'd be standing there, uh, silent, because I kind of need that silence control"

**Jen on structured vs. unstructured social situations:**
> "whereas behind the scene I don't know what my job is. I don't know what's expected of me on that social waiting. Everybody else is nervous to go out there. I'm anxious to get out there. Like I want to go out there and I think it's that it's that sort of we don't know what's expected of us."

**Alex on controlled performance environment:**
> "when else do I get to just stand here and say whatever is on my mind? And you'd [get a captive audience]... Yeah. I [don't] really care. I'm sure if they're bored, they'll make it pretty well known, but it's a captive audience."

**Jen on audience expectations:**
> "And they, they want this. They want this. Oh, it's the best feeling. Yeah."

## On Mental Health and Creative Expression

**Jen on early relationship with art:**
> "some of my earliest sort of, Memories of where it was helpful on a mental health standpoint, uh, we used to go on vacation to the Oregon coast and I would, uh, I would lock myself away in this room that we got in this little sort of vacation rental type. Place in front of a window with my Sony Walkman headphones on drawing, like, and that was just my idea of happiness alone, locked in a room drawing, looking out a window at the beach, right?"

**Jen on art as voice without direct expression:**
> "for. Not feeling seen not feeling like I really have a voice and I'm very introverted outside of the performance side as well Very, you know insular private type person the creative stuff gives you a voice without Needing to say this is me. This is Jen saying this Um, I can say it as a character, I can say it through the art and just anything that would kind of give me a voice without having to point at myself, this is what Jen thinks"

**Jen on the therapy distinction:**
> "one of the phrases that we use quite often in the improv community is improv is not therapy. So improv can be therapeutic. Um, but we're not just, we're not using the scene for therapy. Like that's, that's the part we want to avoid, but we can absolutely. Use the feelings that are, that are in there"

## On Authenticity in Creative Work

**Alex on inevitable self-expression:**
> "I've said this a few times on this podcast that, um, you're, you're there all over your work, right? [You can't avoid] it. And, and, and even if you don't see um, that it's coming out and it's, it's, it's there, um, other people will, uh, and, uh, and I agree with you, I don't, I don't think you can stop it."

**Jen on unconscious self-revelation:**
> "I don't think you can either. It just comes out. It's, it's surprising. Like in the writing in this podcast series that I'm doing right now, it's like, oh, I could, I, it's not intentional, but then you read it back after you're kind of editing it. You're like, okay, yeah, I see some. I see some parallels to my own life here."

## On Alexithymia and Performance

**Alex explaining alexithymia:**
> "alexithymia is, um, I think, I think anyone can have it really, but it's, it's very common in autistic people where you can't, you don't. Recognize your own emotions. You don't either. You don't recognize that they're happening... You might be really, really, really hungry and just not notice it. And then suddenly, bam, out of nowhere, like, well, how, why am I so stressed?"

**Jen on working with alexithymia in improv:**
> "I also have alexithymia. Um, and so labeling those emotions, even well, after the fact, I couldn't do, I didn't really know why I couldn't do those exercises... but I figured out my own way to sort of handle that sort of thing and how to, how to, I don't need to label it. I can just do a rough approximation and what that means to me, right? Like that will still work"

**Jen on shared understanding:**
> "one of my favorite scenes was, I knew the other person in the scene quite well. I knew that they had alexithymia as well, and we were doing an emotion scene where we're each given the label. And so I made some little comment just kind of knowing my scene partner and my scene partner picked up on what I meant because it was the actual exercise and we made the whole scene about alexithymia without using the word alexithymia, but we knew what we were talking about and it gave me so much joy."

## On Performance Benefits and Recommendations

**Jen on the transformative potential:**
> "I absolutely, uh, I think it's worth trying. I think it's something that I never, I never thought I would enjoy performance... And when I started it, I, first of all, I kind of, Ended up doing it by accident, performing by accident... it terrified me. It terrified me going up in front of a group. Um, I was, I was shaking, but then as soon as I got up there, it was just like this relief and comfort. And I was like, what, how did that happen?"

**Jen on mental health benefits:**
> "it's has brought some of the greatest joy in my life doing it. And it is mental health. It just helped balance me like nothing else. So it's worth trying."

**Jen on the learning process:**
> "anything that you're learning is a hard new skill. You know, improv has the similarities. I, it took a long time for me to learn the rules and learn all those guardrails and have it become sort of more of an automated thing. I'm not stressing and thinking about, and that automation, that's sort of the way that your brain operates when you can kind of let go and just have fun."

## On Natural vs. Developed Abilities

**Alex asking about personal change:**
> "do you feel like, uh, your experience, you know, through these various types of performance, do you think it's changed you or do you think that, you know, you've, you've just brought out something was, was naturally there underneath?"

**Jen's response:**
> "I think it brought out something that was naturally there underneath... I think it just, it revealed, it revealed something that was there. It gave, it gave me permission to, to be that or express that in some way."

## Interview Dynamic and Self-Reflection

**Alex on masking and performance:**
> "Especially when I think about autism and masking. Well, I'm acting all the time, right? I have to act like a normal human being almost 24 hours a day. So I should be able to act like, you know, other types of human being."

**Alex on interview improvisation:**
> "I guess I'm improvising right now. I'm like, so you, [we agreed before] when we were talking before this, I just wing it right at these interviews. And, um, and so I am improvising. So I guess I, um, I guess I do understand."
