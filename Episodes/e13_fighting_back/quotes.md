# Episode 13: Fighting Back - Significant Quotes

## Opening Mission Statement
> "Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an interest in mental health and well-being."

## Mental Health Reality
> "It might seem like I've got it all figured out. It might seem a prerequisite for someone who creates a podcast on healing mental illness through art to have figured out how to do exactly that but you don't just switch off mental illness in the same way you can't just switch off a broken leg."

> "Healing is an ongoing process and when your neurological afflictions run as deep and as long as mine do it's arguable that this process never ends. I at least have accepted that it never will."

## Chronic Condition Analogy
> "I've made peace with this in the same way that a diabetic or an asthmatic must make peace with their affliction. Like these afflictions mental illness and its inverse mental wellness ebb and flow in presence and intensity."

## Environmental Factors
> "My ability to maintain my mental health is tightly bound to my environment and environments aren't constant. Circumstances change whether we want them to or not and sometimes in ways that are dissatisfying and perhaps even unsettling or even alarming. Life happens and doesn't much care about my psychological fragility and this is where I'm at."

## The Dual Self Framework
> "I frequently talk about myself as two people ADHD Alex and autistic Alex. These two sides of me are somewhat at odds. They have different and often conflicting needs. ADHD Alex generally likes change. He certainly likes novelty. Autistic Alex abores change. He likes predictability and routine."

> "When either side of me is significantly out of kilter both suffer. It's arguable that there is a third Alex in the mix. The gestalt being that is the combination of ADHD Alex and autistic Alex..."

## Trauma and Loss
> "However through the generosity and grace of a good friend we found a temporary solution to our housing problem replete with a wonderful workshop stroke studio. Thank heaven for small or in this case huge mercies. But mercies accepted trauma is trauma."

## Art as Double-Edged Tool
> "So was all that time immersed in my art in prep for the show actually doing me harm? Not at all I think the only reason I was able to block all my problems out was because I found the act of creation so immersive. There's a lesson there I guess like any other treatment or therapy art is only truly effective when wielded properly."

## Crisis Description
> "I fell apart. I'm not going to go into all the yucky details but suffice to say this was a weeping snotty crisis rather than a screaming breaking stuff one. I just felt so desperately sorry for myself so apoplectically angry at the world."

> "I decided my life wasn't worth living which of course is nonsense but mental illness is not rational and pain is pain regardless of whether caused by a broken leg or a broken brain."

## Rick and Morty Analogy
> "The relationship between the two sides of my brain is pretty well described by Rick and Morty at their most self-destructive. Rick drags them both on some crazy adventure while Morty gets increasingly distressed and frequently goes into full-on meltdown."

## Limbo as Trauma
> "And if there's one state that massively traumatizes both ADHD Alex and autistic Alex and therefore gestalt Alex it's being in limbo. Autistic Alex hates the uncertainty and ADHD Alex finds the implicit lack of options unbearable."

## Brain Healing Philosophy
> "You're asking the organ that stressed or damaged the brain to heal itself. Not only that you're asking it to figure out how to do that itself. This is not as strange as it might sound. When you have a broken leg your leg knows how to fix itself. It just needs a space to get on with it otherwise known as rest."

## Training Analogy
> "If you want to run a 5k and you've never run one before the best thing to do is give your body regular and ongoing examples of what you expect of it and let it do the rest. You can't think your muscles into growing in the right ways. Only they can do that."

## Conductor Metaphor
> "A bit like a conductor for an orchestra. Her job is to make sure that everyone is doing the right thing when they're supposed to. She doesn't tell them how to play their instrument though."

## Practical Application
> "If you're stressed or anxious you need to show your brain, your emotional brain, what you expect from it which in this case is calm. So do something that makes you calm."

## Art for Calm
> "I make pictures with paint and pencils and anything else that comes to hand. This makes me calm. It's what I've been doing for weeks."

## Real-Time Processing
> "When did I recognize this? When did I figure out that I was unhealthily delaying facing up to my situation while simultaneously exacerbating my psychological problems? When I wrote that last paragraph that's when as I write this one as I read this out to you the act of creation is an act of cleansing is an act of processing is an act of love."

## Distress Spiral Recognition
> "What I told them was that their anxiety and pain and distress were real and justified and valid. But there comes a point when your reaction becomes a problem. You're freaking out because you're freaking out. Distress breeds distress and every level of distress amplifies the original problem."

## The Magnification Effect
> "The original problem has usually not really changed, but over time it starts to seem so much worse. But it's not worse really. You've just zoomed into it like you've looked down at it for an increasingly powerful microscope. But the magnification is an illusion brought on by the distress perpetuating itself."

## Fighting Back Declaration
> "At some point you need to realize that regardless of your problem, if you don't get a handle on the distress itself, which is caused by your reaction to the problem, then things are only going to get worse. At that point you need to treat the distress itself as the enemy."

> "So this is my fight back. I choose to recognize distress itself as my enemy and to face it down. To do this I need to accept the fact while recognizing my situation on its face values, it is what it is, nothing more, nothing less."

## Recovery Commitment
> "I will keep taking on reality one day at a time, I will keep fighting, I will get better and I acknowledge that there will be peaks and troughs, but I choose to keep fighting."

## Public Accountability
> "My point is that if I tell enough people that I'm going to get better, if I commit to getting better, maybe I'll actually do it. As I say, I hate to disappoint."

## Recovery Requirements
> "Recovery takes self-care honestly with oneself and help from others. It needs communication, thoughtful action and humility."

## Hope and Purpose
> "So there's my confessional. I hope you found it helpful, and maybe even hopeful."
