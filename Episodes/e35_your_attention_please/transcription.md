Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and wellbeing. Yo, welcome back. For anyone listening to this on
audio only, there's a video version on YouTube if you'd prefer to experience this with my
beautiful face staring out at you. I've had a bit of a struggle getting the next episode of this
podcast out. This isn't part due to general life circumstances and in part due to my latest
obsession which is wood carving. If you look at my YouTube channel then you'll see plenty of
evidence of this and I've talked about it in past episodes of this podcast and it's taking up quite
a lot of my time. I can get lost in the process of taking words and drawing out the forms within it
to produce something else and something new and I just love the sort of tactile experience of it
and the way that I can work with something in three dimensions, really not knowing what it is
I'm going to produce and just see where the wood itself leads me. It's such an ephemeral experience.
You never know what's going to come out of the wood, what you're going to find when you
saw into it or sand it down and I find myself getting completely absorbed for hours and hours
on end and I can't draw myself away from it. This is in part due to a little known fact of ADHD
which is hyper focus which either inflicts or affords ADHD as with the ability to focus on
something for long periods and find it very very difficult to tear ourselves away. This can be
help in such cases as this or when you've got say a project at work or something that you need to
desperately focus on. If your brain gets engaged enough in it and you trigger some hyper focus then
you're going to be super productive. The flip side is if whatever you're trying to do or you need to
do is not particularly interesting or engaging for your brain at that point then you're going
to find it very difficult to do it and your focus might well be drawn somewhere else perhaps
to hyper focus on something that is far less useful or valuable and helpful and at the expense
of the stuff you need to do so it can be a real hindrance. At the moment I'm finding the wood
carving obsession to be quite absorbing, very very relaxing, very very mindful and given I have
relatively few pressures on my time at the moment it feels like a good way to spend my time.
So I'm sort of letting it happen but I tend to let my hyper focus episodes
drag on longer than they should. It's pretty typical, it's very hard to untransfix yourself
once you're in one of those modes but I have some ability to do it. I have a small amount
of willpower and if there's something I desperately need to do I'll tear myself away and do it
eventually but it does mean that I'm sort of left with less time to focus on other things and
I knew for a while at the back of my brain I was overdue another episode of this podcast and
I started writing one fairly feverishly over the last couple of days and took a look at it this
morning with a view to sort of finishing it off, read it top to bottom and realized it was largely
incoherent, didn't make much sense although it sounded great it was largely nonsense and
and there's still something in there which I'll dust off and rewrite at some point in the near
future but I was like well this isn't good enough and and it got me really thinking well you know
why have I struggled to get this out you know why did I have to rush this well because my attention
is somewhere else and and it got me thinking about attention and I've been wanting to talk
about this in more detail for quite a while because at the heart of it attention is arguably
the most valuable commodity in the world. It's more valuable than gold, it's more valuable than
oil, it's simply the thing that more money and more focus has been placed on mining over the last
decade or so than any other single thing. Everything that Facebook or Instagram, TikTok,
Twitter, stroke X, all of these apps exist to attain and hold your attention
and to then mine that for value in terms of of advertising money or selling you stuff and
they're designed specifically to get you locked in to the experience and not wanting to go and
do anything else, not wanting to go look at another website or another app and they'll pay
vast amounts of money to do that and then we find ourselves also in in a certain political environment
that is dominated by two of arguably the most able and effective attention seekers of all time
Donald Trump and Elon Musk who are dominating people's attentions on every possible medium
and set their whole stall on it. These two may have other interests on the outside but the way
they got their power, the way they got their wealth was simply through being big old attention
seekers and being particularly good at it and and so your attention is really really important.
So I'm talking about this in terms of your attention being important to other people
but it's also the most important thing that you yourself have. We have a finite amount of
attention, we have a limited lifespan and we spend around a third of it asleep. You can lose
hours and hours and hours by sitting in a car and the world passes you by and you don't even
recognize that that time has passed and it feels like you've got in a time machine and
you've just lost two hours or something and that part of your life was gone. You have almost no
memory of it. We have this ability to sort of transcend time via the the suppression of attention
but the time you do experience, the times that matter, the times that create memories
and the times that you experience things like joy or fear or any intense emotions, these are the
times when your intention is front and center and placing all the emphasis on what it is you're doing
and and this is all there is. So a good portion of the time you're either asleep or tuned out,
the rest of the time this is where life happens. So you might think the most valuable thing in your
life is your new baby, your partner, your family, your beloved pet but really what it is that you're
valuing there is time spent directing your attention towards those things and that's the
most valuable time you have. So when you're doom scrolling through x, finding yourself getting all
worked up but also not able to disengage, you are spending that valuable attention on something that
probably isn't worth your attention. It's worth a lot to Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg.
It's worth way more to you because these are the times that your memories are formed. These are the
activities to inform how your nervous system should behave and that will inform your emotional
reactions to things and maybe you're passing the time playing Candy Crush or whatever the current
gaming app obsession is or maybe you're scrolling social media or watching
inane videos on TikTok and maybe this is exactly what you want to be doing.
Maybe this is truly your best use of your time and that's what you should be doing and good on
you and keep doing it and I hope it continues to be good for you but I suspect for most people
actually that if they thought about it the time spent scrolling through social media
was not the highest quality time that they spent in their day and maybe they wish in retrospect
that they'd spent that time with their partner, with their pet, with their kids, or doing something
creative, making something valuable, contributing to the world and contributing to community.
Now I don't mean this in the in the haughty sense in that you have to spend all your time
doing valuable things that contributes to the furtherment of the human race but I do think
people spend far more of their time and therefore their attention on things that don't even matter
to them. If what matters to you is scrolling through social media then you're using your
time really well but if what matters to you is time with your family then you're wasting it
and what matters to me is time spent creating things and exploring the world, learning,
trying new things and also spending time with my family, also spending time within the community.
This stuff matters to me, I enjoy doing it. I'd rather be doing that stuff than almost anything else
and I recognize that myself as well as everyone else we have responsibilities and commitments.
I hope that some or most of you have for example a job that you at least don't hate or maybe you're
lucky enough to have one that you love and the place where you would want to focus your attention
is also the place that you are paid to focus your attention and I can't imagine a better
life to live than that but for most of us it's a bit of a trade-off. What is the value
of your job versus the value of time with your family or on your passions?
And for the most privileged among us it's a trade-off in terms of well how much do you have to
pay me to not spend time on those things and spend time doing something for you.
It's a trade-off I think many people don't really think about especially when you get yourself into
a career trajectory that seems to reach out more and more of your time and then suddenly you find
you've got a family and other responsibilities on your hands and it feels a lot harder a trade-off
but that trade-off still exists. Ultimately you need what you need to stay alive, to feed yourself,
your family, to clothe yourselves and to keep a roof over your head but if you're spending
lots and lots of time on a job that pays lots and lots of money to upkeep yourself and your family's
opulent lifestyle you need to question as to whether where you really deeply want to be paying
your attention is actually your job and really the thing that you're doing your job to support
that lifestyle because if you really truly valued time with the people you loved then you would
trade off the lifestyle and therefore the job with time spent with them. Now I realize this is quite
condescending, life is not that simple I'm just trying to paint a picture of the trade-offs that
we all have to make all day every day and I recognize there's plenty of people perhaps
the majority of people out there that don't get to make that choice that they have to do the job
that they do because that's the one they can get and they need to do that and they need to spend
a certain amount of time on that to be able to just simply survive and my sympathy goes out to
those people and it's a struggle these people don't get to make the choice as to where they
put their attention but for any of the rest of us who have a little bit more agency over our life
I think it's our responsibility to use our time how suits us because we have the ability to do so
this is not just a factor of the present I'm deliberately restraining myself from going all
Zen on you all right now there's plenty of references to Zen in in the past episodes of
this podcast and no doubt there will be in the future but Zen very much focuses on the now
and of course that is the important moment in time but what the now is what attention really is
is your memory factory because time is fleeting because it's constantly moving because situations
change priorities change the weather changes everything changes around you your environment
your needs you can't stand still you can't experience this wonderful moment for the rest
of your life there will be a time where this moment is very different and and so the things
we pay attention to or are forced to pay attention to are the bedrock of our memory the thing that
you paid attention to that created strong emotions in you be they negative or positive are the things
that's going to root themselves in your memory most strongly these are the things that your brain
will use to inform itself in in terms of the decisions that it makes and your emotional
responses to your environment in the future the moments with the most emotional resonance are the
ones that will stick with us most strongly and that that seems fairly intuitively obvious but
I think a lot of people don't think about that in the moment if you're not really present with the
thing that you're doing if you're not really focusing your attention on something that
matters and that will feel like it matters to your future self then either you're not creating
memories i won't remember much about what happened in this this moment in your life
or you're creating memories that are trash and so if you spend your whole time on x getting angry
about donald trump or wanting to take down the next celebrity you're going to have a strong
emotional response to that that's going to form memories that are going to inform how you remember
this era in your life and are you going to think back and see these things as perhaps traumatic
right now is donald trump actually directly impacting your life to the negative or i guess
to the positive well for some people yes but for me no so why am i scrolling through uh why in my
case blue sky seeing comments and articles about donald trump and getting annoyed and angry about
those well it's not really much value to me i i can see value in keeping abreast of these things so
we understand what our environment is really like but outside of that continued doom scrolling is
is a very little value and i'm not sure my future self will be very happy with me if it felt that
i'd spent a lot of time doing them so you have to remember that this this moment now is your memory
factory your creations are are distillations of a moment that they are memories made manifest
and so your creation could be a painting or a sculpture or a photo or a or a film or a piece
of writing and and why did you make that you made that because there is some reason some part of your
brain or your life or some necessity that you needed to do that i think my my necessity right
now is the need to be calm and focused and and relaxed uh and to not repeat my mental health
problems while i have the ability to do so and therefore my time spent hacking into pieces of
wood is valuable and i think my future self will be pleased about it not least because i have these
objects to either remind me of that moment or that i can sell to someone else and i'm manifesting a
flavor of my present in an object that could sit on someone's mouthpiece or hang on their wall
and and that's really good for me it's good for future me it's good for now me and and it will
create good memories not perhaps spectacular memories like that time i went to tokyo and had
the best party i've ever had with a bunch of really cool people after a really really stressful
project at work it won't have the same resonance of that time that i was in crete but i couldn't
enjoy myself because i was so depressed and stressed and burned out because of the state
of my life it's not going to have the same resonance of those things but i think we can't
always have exciting extreme moments and we don't always want that otherwise we'd be psychological
wrecks what we want is a mix of highs and lows and and and our median state the state where the
vast majority of our attention is is occupied to be a happy place to our future self to be a happy
place for our current self and and i think that creativity and creation and art is literally one
of the best ways that you can do that i'm not saying that it's better to spend time in front
of an easel than it is caring for someone who is in distress or you know spending time with your
family or your newborn baby or or even watching telly because these moments are important to us
too sitting down in front of the tv with my wife most evenings is a vital part of my daily routine
and and a vital part of me keeping my mental health and spending time with my wife it's it's
important to me that i do that i don't consider that time wasted and i do like most of the things
we're watching there's plenty of amazing tv out there at the moment and and i don't think my future
self is going to be too grumpy with me about having spent my time doing that i spent hours last night
with a bunch of people framing artworks from um the local school kids for an art competition
they entered uh and we wanted to make it really special for them so we we acquired a bunch of
cheap frames and we all got together and framed them and we put them up gallery style in the
building next door and that is a good use of my time i spent my time around some interesting
cool people doing something that felt really positive i think is going to absolutely delight
those kids and their parents will that be a strong memory for me but almost certainly not
it wasn't a particularly interesting thing to do it was just a good thing to do and a thing that i
i felt was positive and for me that's going to contribute to probably more like a melange of
ambient memories from this moment in time that will in general turn out to be something quite
positive and to help my future self and and i think that's the thing that we really have to
think about is that it's not that you have to be doing something positive but by all means go and
do that it's not that you have to spend every minute trying to change the world by all means
do that if if you have the facility and the desire to do that it's more a case of are you doing the
thing right now that is really benefiting you that is really benefiting those around you that's
achieving something no matter how small that is something your future self is going to look at
and go well that was worth doing and that's the litmus test if if you think about what the thing
you're doing at the moment you think well look this was rubbish but it was a means to an end
and you achieve that end your future self is going to forgive you if you are scrolling through x
getting angry not doing the things you were supposed to do not really seeing any value or
benefit in that and and generally feeling all the wrong types of emotions for the wrong reasons
then that probably isn't something you should be doing your future self is not going to feel proud
that you spent your time doing that your memories of that period are not going to be great
so if all you need or want to do is chill then find ways to do that and look at the things that
you're doing in your life that you have some level of agency or control over and try to understand
whether or not they are something that you really want to be doing and that is giving you the value
in the in the current moment that it should be and i'm guessing if you are listening to or watching
this the creativity forms a fair amount of your existence and that it's something you want to be
doing so you're the part of the way there with that anyway if you can find the time to do this
and it really does benefit you then you should find whatever time you can to do it while also
not sacrificing the other things you need to do for example recording a podcast episode and indeed
in recording podcast episodes i both achieve something i quite enjoy doing i i like the fact
that they're out there and and they're giving my future self a a souvenir of the present that i
think i will consider really valuable and i hope i manage to keep recording these even if it's a
little bit erratic anyway that's all i really wanted to say um i could probably say quite a
lot more on this subject and really your ability to focus your attention on creativity as something
inherently positive to help improve your state of mind and your well-being in the present
which in turn will improve your state of mind and well-being in the future and so in that way you
can see it as an investment and if you think about attention as being the most valuable thing that
you have because it's everything then you can consider investment of that attention on something
valuable and positive as an investment in the future something that will grow something that
will accrue and pay it forward as it were to your future self and indeed will shape their outlook
on on everything that they're experiencing in their present um it feels a bit like time travel
here and maybe some of this stuff's a little bit abstract but i i tend to find myself thinking
about all the awful things i'm doing to my future self and it sort of helps me to try and
be a bit more charitable to him and and this is probably the best way that i can do it that's uh
that's all for now i i feel like i've got a lot more to say on this but i'm i'm not going to um
i'm going to let you put your attention somewhere else maybe this podcast is the place where you
most like to put all your attention and uh thank you very much if you think that's the case but i
think i'm here to urge you to go and do something else and to go and use your attention in the way
that makes you happy so go and do that thank you for joining me again i'll hopefully get this other
episode that i started writing uh recorded now for next week's i'm looking for other creatives
to interview so if you're a creative and listening to this and and want to do an interview with me
for this podcast then please get in touch in the meantime please rate review share like whatever
help me spread the word about this podcast and i'll be back again soon bye
