Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. Once upon a time there was a young girl called Vera
who lived in Cologne, Germany. Vera loved jazz but Cologne wasn't exactly a destination for jazz
scene stars. Unperturbed, 18-year-old Vera took a punt and invited American virtuoso improvisational
jazz pianist Keith Jarrah to come and perform in her jazz-deprived city. To her surprise and joy,
he agreed. On the 24th of January 1975, after a long grueling drive and suffering from back pain,
Jarrah arrived for his 11.30pm performance at the Cologne Opera House. He took a look at the
crappy broken down out of tune piano that the opera house had provided and walked out again,
refusing to perform. Jarrah had asked for a Bozendorfer 290 Imperial Grand Piano. He was very
particular about this. The opera house staff had interpreted that as some Bozendorfer piano or
whatever and rolled out a dusty old practice piano that they found backstage. So basically
Jarrah somewhat understandably pulled the whole how can I create under these conditions routine.
Vera was in a tight spot and 1,400 German jazz fans were waiting expectantly in Cologne Opera
House. This was a disaster. So Vera did what any self-respecting teenager would do in such
conditions. She badgered him until she got what she wanted. Against all odds, Jarrah took pity on the
way and soaked. I'm imagining it was raining for dramatic effect, teenager and agreed to play. He
hadn't even managed to eat much after his long drive and he was tired and in pain. By the time
he re-entered the auditorium, the piano had been tuned but a bunch of the keys weren't working
and it wasn't nearly big enough to be heard across an auditorium of that size. Jarrah assumed he was
about to give the worst performance of his career, but the German kids seemed so miserable and they
already set up the recording equipment. So what the hell? The thing is Jarrah was a genuinely
prodigious pianist. He knew his way around the piano. The limitations of the offending piano
forced him to be much more creative in his delivery, both in terms of his note choices,
but he also had to hammer at the keys in a way that he wouldn't usually just so it could be heard.
The resulting performance, which was recorded and can be tracked down easily on all the usual
streaming platforms, is considered nothing short of legendary. One of the most revered, venerated,
copied and best-selling jazz recordings of all time. It propelled Jarrah from being a
preternaturally talented upstart to being a major force in modern jazz. In jazz terms this most
definitely counts as a fairy tale. What lessons are there to be learned from this story? I think
there are a few. There's probably quite a lot to be said for proper preparation if you want a quiet
life and completely conversely the oldswell that ends well. But it's what this story and some
others which I will touch upon tell us about creativity that I want to focus on. I'm actually
going to spend a couple of episodes talking about the nature of creativity. Maybe more, because I
think it's essential to understand the role that creativity plays in the therapeutic power of art
and the creative process. As I've said before, if you can't loosen up a bit, making art isn't going
to feel relaxing and fulfilling. It's going to feel stressful. And relaxation, flow and creativity
all come from the same source. The same spring of magical mystical unicorn juice. But the experience
and understanding of creativity depends heavily on context and your place in the lifelong creative
journey. Put simply, if you're obsessed about doing things right then you'll always be doing
something wrong and you'll almost certainly end up doing the same thing over and over again.
Music, and particularly jazz music, is a good place to start here because during improvisation
creativity happens in real time and in full view. Now I should point out at this point that I'm no
expert on jazz or even particularly a jazz fan. There just so happens to be a few characters
and stories I've come across that help make the points that I need to make. And more generally,
jazz, as opposed to say country music, puts quite a high premium on creativity.
Take jazz saxophonist John Coltrane. He is considered one of the most important jazz
musicians of all time, largely for his improvisational abilities. He reputedly practiced for
16 hours a day. He was good at his instrument. But he was also renowned for his creative approach
to the saxophone and to jazz music and indeed music in general. He was your archetypal innovator.
John Coltrane changed the jazz genre. He was awarded the special Pulitzer Prize in 2007 citing his
masterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz.
He was even made a saint by the African Orthodox Church.
Does this suggest that you need to be a virtuoso to be able to improvise or innovate?
If we think of innovators in other fields, they also seem to be crazy talented prodigies and or
big brains. Think Einstein, Da Vinci, Bach, Bowie, Bill Gates, probably some sports people. I don't
pay any attention to sports. Ronnie O'Sullivan fits the bill I guess. But there are plenty of
virtuosos out there that neither improvise nor innovate. Top tier concert violinists for example
may bring innovative flourishes to their renditions of others works, but little in the way of raw
creativity, much of which will have come from the composer. Walk into your local art gallery and you
might find some supremely able painters, but how many of them are using that ability to pump out
fairly pedestrian landscapes? Every field is jammed to the gills of orso rants that pump out
solid work, but did little to really move the dial in their respective fields. No, Coltrane didn't
change jazz because he was a boss saxophonist. He had some other secret sauce. So what did Coltrane
do that was so disruptive to the jazz genre? Well strictly speaking nothing, at least not alone.
He was part of the movement that included another pioneering jazz legend, Miles Davis,
which innovated a form of jazz known as modal jazz. The musical theory of what modal jazz
actually is is somewhat brain bending, so I'll not attempt to characterize it here other than via a
rudimentary description. I'll put some links in the show notes for anyone masochistic enough to
want to know more. Put simply, most music uses chord changes to drive the melody and the movements
within the piece. Modal jazz instead uses modes, which are basically scales of the sort that you
were forced to learn during those piano lessons that you did when you were a kid and that petered
out because they were so dull. Often modal jazz is performed as lengthy jams over a single chord,
with melody and structure defined by changes in the modes used. I think, anyway, it's all very
confusing. Just go listen to it. Listen to Coltrane's magnum opus, 1965's A Love Supreme, and you'll get
a sense of it. It's easier to just listen to it than try and describe what's actually going on.
It represents a musical intersection of hyper minimalism and hyper complexity. It's a music
of dichotomies and extremes. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but I've no interest in the conversation
about whether this is style over substance. Whether enjoyability or even listenability has
been sacrificed in the name of technical prowess or the pursuit of pure cold artistic abstraction.
Many people love this music. I've included a link in the show notes of a podcast where a couple of
guys get something akin to sexually aroused listening to the aforementioned A Love Supreme.
That whole episode's worth a listen, as they state various views on the nature of art that are very
much congruent with my own and therefore a good corollary to this and future episodes. As an
aficionado of the most wonderful music form known as death metal, I have little time for views that,
for example, assert that melody is an essential component for something wishing to be classified
as music. That said, this particular debate is one that I'm going to come back to at some point,
maybe as part of this series. I guess we'll find out. Back to Coltrane. Far from being cold or
aloofly technical, A Love Supreme is specifically and intentionally an act of worship, an act of
love. It is the document of Coltrane's reverence for both the transcendent powers of jazz music,
but also of God, hymn stroke herself. And this is where we start to glimpse Coltrane's secret source,
for he was both obsessive and eclectic. He was a scholar and a spiritualist. Coltrane was a man
of extremes, of contradictions. Race as a Christian, he largely considered himself a Christian and was
by all accounts a true believer, a profoundly spiritual person. Yet he frequently integrated
beliefs, doctrines and practices from other diverse world religion into his own worldview.
This included Kabbalah, Hinduism, Islam and Tibetan and Zen Buddhism. This inevitably
found its way into his music. This compulsive culture and spiritual kleptomania was part of
his core approach to music. Coltrane, into both techniques, approaches themes and motifs from all
over the world, including from African music and particularly India. Collaborating with legendary
Beatles approved sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar, who by some accounts thought Coltrane was nuts.
And all this might seem to imply that he did this alone. But Coltrane worked with some well-class
musicians. Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk and Duke Ellington are among the names that you've
likely heard of. Each no doubt a melting pot of creative collaboration. But it's with his long
time bandmates, the Coltrane Quartet, where the magic really happened. When Coltrane, double bassist
Jimmy Garrison, drummer Elvin Jones and pianist McCoy Tyner got in a room together, something
really special happened. Coltrane's compositions were sparse at best and offered little in the way
of direction to fellow bandmates, instead relying on a shared understanding of each other's style,
audible and visual cues, and a deep understanding of the jazz art form. What emerges is a semi
improvised melange of diverse music styles that lead to innovation in real time. He and his band
were making creative leaps unconsciously as they recorded. For Coltrane, this was like prayer,
or perhaps more accurately, meditation. He and his bandmates could achieve chance-like
states of pure mindfulness. This is common among musicians, particularly while improvising,
but these guys weren't just in a world of their own, although sometimes it might sound like it,
but they were in constant telepathy-like communication, reacting to each other's
playing in real time in ways that are seamless to the rest of us.
I'm not trying to sell you on free-form, avant-garde jazz here. I'm very far from
being sold on it myself. It's the sort of music that I want to like, but largely leaves me cold.
But I can hear their passion and their focus. It's hard to find another art form that makes
the creative process this manifest. It's hard to pass for us mere mortals for sure,
and the theory of it is largely beyond me to understand, let alone explain,
but as I've suggested, there's something to be learned here about the process of creativity.
So let me summarize some of the things that are going on here that seem to be driving creativity.
1. Ability or mastery within the medium
We'll come back to this one a fair bit. I think this requirement is overstated,
but a good understanding of the medium is essential. As Coltrane himself stated,
you can play a shoestring if you're sincere.
2. Conviction
Or passion, or maybe authenticity, although the latter is, as I've stated before, to my mind,
overused and nebulous as a concept. What we really mean here is that sense that the
artist really believes in what they're doing, that they care deeply and approach it with zeal
and enthusiasm. I'd rather spend time with a passionate trained spotter than a cynical or
ingenuine classical composer. 3. Eclecticism, aka curiosity,
an open mind. From my perspective, this is as important as conviction. Coltrane didn't innovate
by doing the same thing over and over. He bought influences from wherever he found it, and he
searched far and wide. Part of the reason that some of his stylistic flourishes feel familiar now
is because he seamlessly integrated them into his own style than everyone else copied him.
3. Input from and collaboration with others
Coltrane collaborated far and wide, as well as with his hardcore of regular bandmates.
You can't help but, if only by osmosis, absorb approaches and ideas from other people who you
work with, and they in turn absorb from you. They take your ideas and expand on them,
based on their own experiences and interactions, and then when you work with them again,
you absorb back your own ideas, but now expanded, mutated, and maybe even improved.
Even if you collaborate with someone who you end up feeling is a complete waste of space,
you still take some knowledge of how NOT to do things away from that experience.
4. The Zone
That mystical state of hyperfocus, more formally known as flow states,
is where the magic of creativity really comes spilling out. That's not to say you can't be
creative at any point. I've come up with new approaches before, while doing mundane tasks like
stretching canvases and then cocking it up. But as I've said earlier, this is where jazz shines,
as you can see innovation as it happens. With those five elements, we can go a very
long way to explaining where creativity comes from. These are the attributes,
or perhaps conditions, that need to be in place for creativity to occur.
Not all of them need to be there for innovation to occur. For example, it's perfectly possible
for someone who never leaves a house or sees anyone else to be creative or innovative,
but it's a lot less likely. Conversely, putting all these things in place does not guarantee
creativity. But there's something missing here, and it goes back to the story I started off with.
It's at work with Coltrane and his compatriots, just in a more subtle and routine way.
And that is randomness, chaos, unpredictability, luck. In the case of Jarrett, the luck was,
on the surface at least, bad, an apparent setback. Really, it was just an unexpected
constraint which forced the pianist to think differently. In the case of Coltrane and Friends,
chaos was their whole approach. Outside of some basic melodic and structural guidelines,
each band member did not know what they were going to play, let alone what everyone else was
going to. By going in somewhat blind, they were deliberately imposing constraints, the influence
of which they were unable to predict, then trusting their own instincts and ability to
not only account for these, but to capitalise on them. So with my original list, mastery,
conviction and open mind, collaboration and focus, you have a set of ingredients that can be put
together in varying measures to cook up something different. But to really mix things up, you need
a sprinkling of chaos. It's like making your omelette with all the usual stuff, then picking
up something random from the fridge or pantry to add in every time you make it to see what works.
Sure, some omelettes will end up being choked down or just thrown in the bin,
but once in a while you'll create something magical. So chaos isn't one of the core ingredients,
it's more like a method or seasoning, it can be applied to any or all of the ingredients
at any point in the process in any amount. It could be argued that as far as creativity is
concerned, it is the magic unicorn juice. I've got a lot more to say about this particular subject,
but I've piled a lot on here, much of which borders on philosophy or at least isn't very
practical. I also worry that this is probably a bit daunting for those just starting out on
their creative journey, so I'm going to shut up for today. In the next episode I will be making
the case for how this works at any point in the creatives maturity. At least I think that's what
I'm going to do. For better or for worse, my pathological propensity to create chaos means
that unpredictability plays a large role in my work. Maybe I'll talk a little bit about that too,
maybe not. In the meantime, if you don't feel like taking my word on all of this,
or you just want to get ahead with some reading, many of the ideas from this and future episodes
are crystallized and expanded upon in the various real world scientific studies by psychologists,
and please forgive me if I get the pronunciation of this wrong, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Csikszentmihalyi
gave us the concept of flow states and in his book Creativity, the psychology of discovery and
innovation, elaborates on many of the subjects discussed here using interviews with and anecdotes
from real world innovators. I'll put a link in the show notes. In the meantime, go and create,
and I'll be back soon. As per usual, if you like this, please tell at least one person to come
