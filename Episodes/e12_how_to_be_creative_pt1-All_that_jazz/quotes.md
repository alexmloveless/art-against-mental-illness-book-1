# Episode 12: How to be Creative Part 1 - All That Jazz
## Significant Passages and Quotes

### Opening Hook - The Cologne Concert Story
> "Once upon a time there was a young girl called Vera who lived in Cologne, Germany. Vera loved jazz but Cologne wasn't exactly a destination for jazz scene stars. Unperturbed, 18-year-old Vera took a punt and invited American virtuoso improvisational jazz pianist Keith Jarrah to come and perform in her jazz-deprived city."

### The Crisis Moment  
> "He took a look at the crappy broken down out of tune piano that the opera house had provided and walked out again, refusing to perform. Jarrah had asked for a Bozendorfer 290 Imperial Grand Piano. He was very particular about this. The opera house staff had interpreted that as some Bozendorfer piano or whatever and rolled out a dusty old practice piano that they found backstage."

### Vera's Determination
> "So Vera did what any self-respecting teenager would do in such conditions. She badgered him until she got what she wanted."

### The Creative Constraint Effect
> "The limitations of the offending piano forced him to be much more creative in his delivery, both in terms of his note choices, but he also had to hammer at the keys in a way that he wouldn't usually just so it could be heard."

### Core Creativity Thesis
> "As I've said before, if you can't loosen up a bit, making art isn't going to feel relaxing and fulfilling. It's going to feel stressful. And relaxation, flow and creativity all come from the same source. The same spring of magical mystical unicorn juice."

### The Right vs Wrong Paradox
> "Put simply, if you're obsessed about doing things right then you'll always be doing something wrong and you'll almost certainly end up doing the same thing over and over again."

### Coltrane's Mastery Quote
> "As Coltrane himself stated, you can play a shoestring if you're sincere."

### Passion Over Technique
> "I'd rather spend time with a passionate trained spotter than a cynical or ingenuine classical composer."

### Innovation Through Eclecticism  
> "Coltrane didn't innovate by doing the same thing over and over. He bought influences from wherever he found it, and he searched far and wide. Part of the reason that some of his stylistic flourishes feel familiar now is because he seamlessly integrated them into his own style than everyone else copied him."

### Collaborative Creative Exchange
> "You can't help but, if only by osmosis, absorb approaches and ideas from other people who you work with, and they in turn absorb from you. They take your ideas and expand on them, based on their own experiences and interactions, and then when you work with them again, you absorb back your own ideas, but now expanded, mutated, and maybe even improved."

### Coltrane's Spiritual Dimension
> "Far from being cold or aloofly technical, A Love Supreme is specifically and intentionally an act of worship, an act of love. It is the document of Coltrane's reverence for both the transcendent powers of jazz music, but also of God, hymn stroke herself."

### Spiritual Eclecticism
> "This compulsive culture and spiritual kleptomania was part of his core approach to music. Coltrane, into both techniques, approaches themes and motifs from all over the world, including from African music and particularly India."

### The Telepathic Band Communication
> "He and his bandmates could achieve chance-like states of pure mindfulness. This is common among musicians, particularly while improvising, but these guys weren't just in a world of their own, although sometimes it might sound like it, but they were in constant telepathy-like communication, reacting to each other's playing in real time in ways that are seamless to the rest of us."

### Modal Jazz as Prayer
> "For Coltrane, this was like prayer, or perhaps more accurately, meditation."

### The Chaos Ingredient
> "But to really mix things up, you need a sprinkling of chaos. It's like making your omelette with all the usual stuff, then picking up something random from the fridge or pantry to add in every time you make it to see what works. Sure, some omelettes will end up being choked down or just thrown in the bin, but once in a while you'll create something magical."

### Chaos as Method
> "So chaos isn't one of the core ingredients, it's more like a method or seasoning, it can be applied to any or all of the ingredients at any point in the process in any amount. It could be argued that as far as creativity is concerned, it is the magic unicorn juice."

### Coltrane's Deliberate Chaos
> "Outside of some basic melodic and structural guidelines, each band member did not know what they were going to play, let alone what everyone else was going to. By going in somewhat blind, they were deliberately imposing constraints, the influence of which they were unable to predict, then trusting their own instincts and ability to not only account for these, but to capitalise on them."

### Flow States and Jazz Innovation
> "That mystical state of hyperfocus, more formally known as flow states, is where the magic of creativity really comes spilling out. That's not to say you can't be creative at any point. I've come up with new approaches before, while doing mundane tasks like stretching canvases and then cocking it up. But as I've said earlier, this is where jazz shines, as you can see innovation as it happens."

### Alex's Creative Chaos
> "For better or for worse, my pathological propensity to create chaos means that unpredictability plays a large role in my work."

### Death Metal Perspective on Music
> "As an aficionado of the most wonderful music form known as death metal, I have little time for views that, for example, assert that melody is an essential component for something wishing to be classified as music."
