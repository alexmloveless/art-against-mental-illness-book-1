welcome to the art against mental illness podcast my name is Alex lovess and this is my podcast about the healing powers of art for artists art lovers the art curious and anyone with an interest in mental health and well-being hello and welcome back to my studio in deepest darkest Central Scotland last episode I talked about getting started and how difficult that can be sometimes this time I'm going to talk about what you do once you've got started either at the beginning of your creative Journey or the next phase or even your next artwork now I wasn't intending for this to get all deep and philosophical but when I was writing the notes for this that's basically what happened so strap in here it goes so I'm going to talk about process I'm not massively comfortable with that word it's not terribly sexy in fact it's quite the opposite but it seems the most appropriate word and I guess the fact that process tends to be a bit of a dirty word is what I want to talk about so it's probably a good idea to start by stating what I mean by process so I Googled the definition and the first one that came up was a systematic series of actions directed to some end which is likely a definition we can all agree on you might think this is a pretty good summary of the subjective experience of making artwork although I don't take issue with it per se the spirit of the definition is what I take issue with I take issue with the idea that a series of actions and the Endo are in any way different you may think the purpose of the creative process is to make stuff which is definitely true to a degree but what I want to talk about is how important the process of making that stuff is both in general and in terms of the therapeutic value of art it's my belief that the Journey of creation is perhaps the most important thing as far as mental Wellness is concerned now this might seem like something that should only concern experienced artists but as a beginner or an Enthusiast understanding a value of process the whole process will make your progression easier and so much more rewarding and beneficial this means leaning into process as part of the creative and healing Journey seeing the whole process as part of the finished product and understanding that that product is never really finished how I think about processes informed by Zen Buddhism Zen and Buddhism in general recognizes in the most literal sense that there is and only ever was one moment and that moment is now much of what we think of in the West's mindfulness deres from this concept if you spend your whole time dreaming about something you'll be doing in some future time that you really want to be doing you are committing the cardinal sin in Buddhism which is wasting the only moment that actually exists which is right now everything you ever did all the past Nows exist just to get to this now everything so while you might be on your dream holiday right now in the Mal Dives there was a now 3 weeks ago where you were sitting in the freezing house eating stale Corn Flakes and lukewarm milk where you were preparing for now and likewise this moment on the white sandy beach is preparation for the next cold cornflakes eating moment every moment is preparation for every other moment so what does all this have to do in Mak an art well put simply you may think that the only moments you're making art is when you're sat in front of the easel or prancing around with your 3,000 quid SLR but assuming you actually make some art at some point in the future you're in the process of making that art right now even if you're sitting on the bog the point is that any of the process is all of the process and since you can't produce that work of artistic genius without having eaten then eating was part of that process Zen Buddhists take this concept really seriously to the point where Zen's primary text Master dogen's shozo contains lengthly chapters on eating getting dressed and going to the toilet so do you need to include taking a dump in your creative process maybe the stuff you certainly should include is cleaning and tidying your art studio washing brushes taking a walk on your own journaling hanging off having a run anything that gets you further towards the next point in that process my point is if you're rushing through the Preparatory stages of making something with gritted impatient teeth then you're not only making yourself needlessly miserable you're actually doing it wrong it all matters in the context of artist therapy this is hugely important concept A Moment resented is a moment of potential healing wasted and another little cut to add to the thousands you already have I found this realization incredibly liberating I learned to love all the nitty-gritty of the process of making art actually I didn't learn to love sweeping the floor of my studio I learned I already loved it that feeling of frustration or impatience I had was created by the false belief that the only time I was actually making art was when I was in front of an easel with a paintbrush in my hand think of it like when you have a really tasty samage ready to eat and you're looking forward to it but then it's finished and you didn't notice because you were too busy answering some BS work Emil or whatever maybe once in a while you stopped to think I'm sure I really enjoyed that sandwich but I don't really remember eating it at all most of the time the memory of that awesome sandwich is entirely gone it was just another step on the journey to doing whatever supposedly important thing you thought you were supposed to be doing but maybe eating that sandwich was the best part of your day and to all intents and purposes you missed it I love tidying my studio but I don't do it a lot I used to think that this is because I'm lazy which is sort of the case I am a bit but I'm also usually quite busy and prioritize making art assuming that the studio isn't too messy to do that but these days I like to think that I save it for the special occasions when I've really got the time to appreciate it and having a tidy studio is such a gift so much so that it's often been an impetus to make more cool stuff once it's tidy when you think about it like that it's obvious that tidying the studio is part of the creative process not an impediment to it what we're saying here is that the process and the product are the same thing which makes sense when you think about it the process is right there on the canvas or the page or the camera along with all the other bits of you from your life experiences and stuff you experienced that day and all the other things you were thinking about at the time I recently worked on a commission while listening to the audio book of The Great Gatsby and you can bet bits of that found itself smeared all over the canvas literally in some cases since I actually printed out some bits of text from the book and glued them to the canvas so if you agree with my core thesis artist therapy and that all these other apparently non-art related tasks are actually part of the art then by embracing this you've literally increase your quot of daily therapy by really quite a lot you need to stop thinking of cleaning your brushes as a chore and see it as a beautiful gift this applies even when you're feeling really low perhaps so low you can't find any Creative Energy at all fairly recently I found myself in a very dark space and somehow couldn't find the mental space to create anything new I just went into my studio and started tidying and rearranging ing it was such an immersive activity that the problems receded into the background I think I started to task out of indignation I let my studio get into such a state but I soon started really enjoying it stepping back at the end to a tidy Studio which I had seemingly conjured double the previous space out of felt like such an achievement it was like I'd done the same thing to my brain there's also the idea that all your works are interlinked anyhow there's likely to be a progression for your artworks from the very first one that you made right through to whatever you're doing now and there's a thread there there's a story and that story really matters you can't ignore all the things that happen between each artwork all these things were part of creating each one of those artworks and and part of the creative progression that people will observe from one to the next they might not be there watching you clean your brushes or stretching a canvas but they are there in spirit in what you bring to your artwork and the process that you went through to make that but all of these things add up to make something that reach other people and to communicate with them that love of every part of the process will show in each final work in terms of its quality in terms of its creativity in terms of its attention to detail in terms of its spirit and passion so what they see really is a version of your process sped up but it's all there they may not see every little thing that you did but they will look at every little detail on that canvas and it will mean something to them anyway I could get lost in explaining the Zen of all this way of thinking if you really follow and extrapolate my logic here you get into some pretty hardcore philosophical territory which is the very essence of Zen but this is not a podcast about then although at least a fair amount of my world viewers to some degree at least been informed by Zen more this is likely to leak out so how does this apply to people just starting their creative journey and you've yet to develop a process well it's really quite easy developing the process is your process the same actually goes for experienced artists because the process never ends it's constantly evolving there is no such thing as becoming a black belt artist there's no highest level great Masters like Michelangelo and da Vinci never stop pushing the boundaries creativity is all about creating something new and since a process and product are the same thing then the process must evolve too this thinking also maps to the concept of progress you may think that a stick figure drawing or angsty team poem is just gassing Craft on the path to Future greatness but that supposed dog roll is part of all your future works i' also bet that it's bring of ideas and enthusiasm and fear and anticipation and lots of other emotions that you're going to spend a lot of time as a mature artist trying to force out onto the canvas and many times failing it's beautiful because it is creation maybe no's going to pay a bunch of money to take your stick figur off your hands but further down the line since it will be interwoven into every other piece of work it is worth something maybe this is all a tad abstract and philosophical but in my mind it's deeply concrete and practical and deadly serious and the implications are pretty transformative we'll revisit this stuff many times in coming episodes particularly when we start talking about perfectionism and procrastination anyway so today's homework your task is to tidy your creative things since I don't know what your particular creative Enterprises I'll make some suggestions and you can figure out what works for you sort and sharpen your drawing pencils tidy your studio organize your poetry folder restring your guitar or rewire your effects board but while you're doing this whatever you end up doing I want you to consider the experience don't think too hard just notice how it makes you feel I think you'll find that since you're spending time with the tools of the activity that bring you Joy you'll find that this activity brings you Joy too okay that's all for today in my next episode I'm going to be tackling the thorny issue of perfectionism thanks again for listening goodbye if you want to find out more about me I can be found on Facebook at Alex Loveless
