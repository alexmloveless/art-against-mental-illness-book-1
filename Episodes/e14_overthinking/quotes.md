# Episode 14: Overthinking - Significant Quotes

## Core Definitions and Insights

### Overthinking as Trauma Response
> "Overthinking is a trauma response. It is a form of anxiety that happens when your general anxiety levels are high and you're afraid of negative consequences from something that you're doing. It's a type of perfectionism that can completely paralyze you from a creative and productivity perspective."
> *Lines 54-57*

### The Pernicious Nature of Overthinking
> "It might not be obvious to you that that's what's going on at the time. It all seems very logical and rational but that's the most pernicious thing about overthinking. It seems to you at that moment in time to be perfectly reasonable and rational and that the task you have to do is really fraught with the danger that you think it is."
> *Lines 61-64*

### Impact on Creativity
> "Overthinking is a poison to spontaneity. An art, regardless how you approach it, is underpinned by spontaneity."
> *Lines 74-76*

## Personal Vulnerability and Mental Health

### Depression's Impact on Self-Esteem
> "my brain decided to stop playing ball. One consequence of what amounts to an onslaught of acute depression and anxiety is a marked dip in self-esteem. This is a very common cause and or side effect of such mental illnesses."
> *Lines 27-29*

### The Shame Wizard
> "With low self-esteem comes constant questioning of everything you do. That nagging sense of what's the point? No one cares. I was never good at this stuff anyway. Everyone hates me. These thoughts are usually illusions. The malignant mirages of a malfunctioning brain but they seem to be pretty real at the time and are hard to ignore. The little demon on your shoulder whispering nasty nothings. For viewers of Big Mouth, this is the shame wizard."
> *Lines 33-37*

### Self-Criticism in Action
> "This is self-indulgent nonsense. Who's going to care? I was just in the middle of a slightly mordelling and self-pitying piece about how a tortured soul like me can't sell any of my tormented masterworks to simple folks who just want something pretty for their dining room wall when such a fit of self-criticism struck. I literally stopped dead in my tracks and thought this is a self-indulgent piece of dull nonsense that no one is going to want to hear."
> *Lines 40-44*

## Creative Process and Trust

### The Nature of Spontaneous Creation
> "The strokes or the marks you put down on a canvas or paper, the notes you lay down on a piano, there's always a level of spontaneity that happens to create the thing in front of you. You are not a machine, you're a sentient being and therefore the job of creation is a process and it's necessarily spontaneous."
> *Lines 76-79*

### Trust in the Creative Process
> "You trust yourself to make judgment calls because when you're creating you're making lots of little judgment calls all the time about what to put where, about in what order to do things, about what materials to use, so on so forth. You trust yourself, you trust that you know in your experience or from what you've been taught that if I do thing A then I get thing B."
> *Lines 86-90*

### Accepting Imperfection
> "Sometimes you'll realize after the fact or maybe during the creation of something that it's not something that people are going to want to see or maybe it's plagiarism or maybe it just sucks balls. There have been some times when you've created something you've looked back and gone yeah this is not great, maybe you paint it out, control aid, delete, throw it away, whatever, you just moved on and you didn't freak out, the world didn't end, you just did something else."
> *Lines 81-85*

## Anxiety and Risk Perception

### The Anxiety Amplification Effect
> "This amplification of risk tends to infect everything you do. Suddenly that relationship problem, those money woes, that issue at work starts to get in the way of literally everything. What's happening is your central nervous system is switched to fight or flight mode. You become perpetually hyper alert to risks of any sort."
> *Lines 119-123*

### Anxiety's Distortion of Reality
> "This is just the basic fact of anxiety because if all your worries seem as ridiculous as they tend to when reflecting on them later you wouldn't be anxious. This is a pernicious nature of anxiety."
> *Lines 94-96*

### The Shadow Metaphor
> "Because you're an experienced mature creator you look at your own work critically which is just what you're doing now right? But this is the literary equivalent of thinking you see an intruder in every dark shadow in your house. You're not any less capable than you were a couple of weeks ago but suddenly it seems that every thought you have is a mature drivel."
> *Lines 126-129*

## Solutions and Recovery

### The Cure for Overthinking
> "Well at the risk of sounding obvious it's to stop overthinking. Now I know that's harder than it might seem and it's sort of a bit of a contradiction in terms but I think the reality is you've just got to do something. Most specifically you've got to do anything. The cure for overthinking is action and in many ways it doesn't matter what action just so you progress somehow."
> *Lines 158-162*

### Natural Creative Flow
> "Creation should feel natural, intuitive. If you force it then your work will likely seem forced to other people and you'll be eroding the joy that you naturally take from the process, a feeling that will stay with you through future works. This stuff accumulates over time like dirt and grit in an engine. Eventually the engine seizes up."
> *Lines 174-177*

### Statistical Reality Check
> "So if you've done say 50 portrait commissions in the past and one of them went astray, that's the one in 50 chance of screwing it up which is pretty small odds of you doing it again. The odds of flubbing it are actually much lower because once you've messed up once you're not going to mess up in that way again and of course that was past you who is much less capable and awesome than you are now."
> *Lines 196-200*

## Therapeutic Insights

### Therapeutic Creativity Requirements
> "For creativity to be therapeutic it needs to be relaxing or at least absorbing. If it's creating anxiety then it's exactly the opposite of what it needs to do."
> *Lines 154-156*

### The Positive Feedback Loop
> "If I can bring some light by using the ability that I have into someone else's world and relieve them of some of their burden I can't think of a better way to use that ability. But I couldn't hear that sane voice. Only the shame wizard sounding sane and logical and telling me I suck."
> *Lines 141-143*

### Core Understanding
> "So remember this, overthinking is a form of anxiety and as rational and sensible as your ruminations and self-criticism seem they're just another symptom of incipient anxiety and what better way to relieve anxiety than the act of creation."
> *Lines 215-217*

## Meta-Commentary

### Podcast as Self-Therapy
> "If you hadn't noticed as well as providing a medium for me to spout my ill-conceived ideas on artist therapy I also use this podcast as a way to think through various issues, to order my thoughts, even to exercise my demons."
> *Lines 49-52*

### The Self-Reflexive Question
> "So the question is did I end up overthinking this one too? Well I finished it which I guess counts for something but perhaps it's for you to decide."
> *Lines 218-219*

## Practical Wisdom

### The Memory Analogy
> "The solution on such occasions is to do something else. That might sound a bit glib, almost a bit defeatist but it's a bit like when you're trying to desperately remember something or to solve some tricky problem. Sometimes you've just got to stop trying, go do something else, sleep on it, then bam! The answer comes to you when you're doing something totally unrelated."
> *Lines 166-170*

### Airplane Safety Analogy
> "It's like being afraid of flying in case of plane crashes. As we all know many tens of thousands of flights happen every day and there's a crash like once every couple of years. There's a lottery winning order probability of getting on a plane that takes a dive."
> *Lines 205-208*

### Final Reality Check
> "Anxiety happens when your brain loses track of the real likelihood of bad things happening. Of course sometimes our problems are real but sometimes our worries about those real problems bleed into other parts of our lives."
> *Lines 213-215*
