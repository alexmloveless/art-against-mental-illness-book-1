Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. There are a few reasons why this podcast is coming out less
frequently. Some of this I discussed in the last episode and I'm not going to rake up all that
depressing stuff again. Suffice to say that my brain decided to stop playing ball. One consequence of
what amounts to an onslaught of acute depression and anxiety is a marked dip in self-esteem. This
is a very common cause and or side effect of such mental illnesses. I'm not going to go into the
neurological foundations of this but suffice to say that humans that are feeling like they are
some sort of god-like genius don't tend to be depressed. That's not to say that narcissists
can't be depressed, it's just that depressed people are by definition not feeling very confident.
With low self-esteem comes constant questioning of everything you do. That nagging sense of
what's the point? No one cares. I was never good at this stuff anyway. Everyone hates me. These
thoughts are usually illusions. The malignant mirages of a malfunctioning brain but they seem
to be pretty real at the time and are hard to ignore. The little demon on your shoulder whispering
nasty nothings. For viewers of Big Mouth, this is the shame wizard. This lovely fellow was at
work while I was attempting to compile no less than three episodes of this podcast, subsequently
aborted. I keep getting halfway through writing them and start thinking to myself where am I
going with this? This is self-indulgent nonsense. Who's going to care? I was just in the middle of
a slightly mordelling and self-pitying piece about how a tortured soul like me can't sell any of my
tormented masterworks to simple folks who just want something pretty for their dining room wall
when such a fit of self-criticism struck. I literally stopped dead in my tracks and thought
this is a self-indulgent piece of dull nonsense that no one is going to want to hear. Now this
might well be the truth but since it's the third such occasion that this has happened it gave me
some pause. I need to get another episode out I thought to myself. I decided yet again to try
something else so I referred to my subject to cover in future episodes list and it took me
literally seconds to stumble across an item that was simply titled overthinking. Bingo!
If you hadn't noticed as well as providing a medium for me to spout my ill-conceived ideas
on artist therapy I also use this podcast as a way to think through various issues, to order my
thoughts, even to exercise my demons. So I immediately recognize an opportunity to work
through my thoughts on overthinking since that's exactly what led me to this point.
Will I overthink this one too? I guess we'll find out.
Overthinking is a trauma response. It is a form of anxiety that happens when your general anxiety
levels are high and you're afraid of negative consequences from something that you're doing.
It's a type of perfectionism that can completely paralyze you from a creative and productivity
perspective. It manifests a need to make sure that what you're going to make or what you're going to
do or what you're going to say is perfect and you become very worried about what might happen if
that's not the case. This often involves internally play-acting the role of another person and how
they might react to what you present to them. This usually leads to assuming the worst about how
they're going to react or what they might say. It might not be obvious to you that that's what's
going on at the time. It all seems very logical and rational but that's the most pernicious thing
about overthinking. It seems to you at that moment in time to be perfectly reasonable and
rational and that the task you have to do is really fraught with the danger that you think it is.
If you're suffering from depression or anxiety you're going to be more prone to having
negative points of view or negative outlooks on anything that's happening in your life.
Anxiety perpetuates anxiety so it can be that anxiety in one part of your life,
perhaps you're worried about something you said to a friend that you thought might be a little
bit hurtful and when you try and write some poetry or paint a picture you start to worry about that
instead, about whether anyone's going to like it or whether you think someone might find it hurtful
or offensive and you freeze, delay, procrastinate. You start to worry about the other areas in your
life and every time you get back to the project you start to meander again and speculate and fret.
But is this overthinking really a problem? A bit of reflection once in a while is a good thing right?
Well let me be explicit about this. Overthinking is a poison to spontaneity.
An art, regardless how you approach it, is underpinned by spontaneity. The strokes or the
marks you put down on a canvas or paper, the notes you lay down on a piano, there's always
a level of spontaneity that happens to create the thing in front of you. You are not a machine,
you're a sentient being and therefore the job of creation is a process and it's necessarily
spontaneous. Now that's not to say that you're never going to produce something that is in fact
offensive or boring or just plain bad. Sometimes you'll realize after the fact or maybe during the
creation of something that it's not something that people are going to want to see or maybe it's
plagiarism or maybe it just sucks balls. There have been some times when you've created something
you've looked back and gone yeah this is not great, maybe you paint it out, control aid, delete,
throw it away, whatever, you just moved on and you didn't freak out, the world didn't end, you just
did something else. This is part of the learning and maturing process and a constant part of the
creative process. After all you can't be a genius all the time. You trust yourself to make judgment
calls because when you're creating you're making lots of little judgment calls all the time
about what to put where, about in what order to do things, about what materials to use, so on so forth.
You trust yourself, you trust that you know in your experience or from what you've been taught
that if I do thing A then I get thing B. But we all make mistakes, we all make decisions that seem
right at the time and don't turn out to be optimal and then we just fix it or we discard it and we
move on. You trust yourself and you trust in your skills. It's all very well however to you know just
decide not to overthink things but it's often hard to know that you're overthinking because by its
nature it feels very real. This is just the basic fact of anxiety because if all your worries seem
as ridiculous as they tend to when reflecting on them later you wouldn't be anxious. This is a
pernicious nature of anxiety. You might well be in a precarious situation. Maybe like me you've lost
your job and your finances are getting tighter. Maybe someone close to you is ill. Maybe you're
in a difficult relationship. Sometimes very bad things do happen and we need to accept and prepare
for those. We need to keep scanning the horizon for danger. This is just a fact of life. No big deal.
But when you're feeling anxious or depressed you start to see bad things everywhere. You start to
look at every slightly adverse situation as a harbinger of something bad. You start to worry
that you're going to run out of money, that you're going to be turfed out onto the street and the
world is going to end and of course that's possible. But you don't think about the fact that any number
of other things could happen to alleviate or avoid this and probably will. You forget that you have
options and there's usually people around you who care and can help out and positive chance events
are just as likely as negative ones. The chances are the bad situation isn't as bad as you think it
is but when you're in a precarious situation where lots of things are not going well and we all find
ourselves in this position in one time or another those things that seem like threats to you are
going to seem much more imminent, much more likely in fact than they really are. And that's why
talking to people like a therapist or a friend often helps. If they're the right type of person
they'll help you frame the problem in the terms of the reality around you that you're struggling to
see. You don't get to forget about your problems, they don't magically disappear but more often than
not when you look back on a time in your life where things were not going too well and that there was
lots of potential problems on the horizon so few of them came about. Things didn't go at all how you
thought they would. The worst case scenario or even close to it is usually much less likely than you
think. Either way you have no idea what's coming down the line. You can control what you can control
and the rest is down to fate. And when the really bad things do happen they often don't unfold as
you think they're going to and providing the bad thing wasn't fatal you generally have a route to
fight back. The only way is up from rock bottom. This amplification of risk tends to infect
everything you do. Suddenly that relationship problem, those money woes, that issue at work
starts to get in the way of literally everything. What's happening is your central nervous system
is switched to fight or flight mode. You become perpetually hyper alert to risks of any sort.
So instead of leaning into that short story that you've been looking forward to writing
you're suddenly questioning whether anyone would want to read it. You start worrying that you'd
be ridiculed if anyone did so. You nitpick and analyse and it all seems perfectly logical.
Because you're an experienced mature creator you look at your own work critically which is just
what you're doing now right? But this is the literary equivalent of thinking you see an intruder
in every dark shadow in your house. You're not any less capable than you were a couple of weeks ago
but suddenly it seems that every thought you have is a mature drivel. So here I found myself
struggling to write one podcast episode after another. I think to myself no one wants to hear
me talking about this stuff. I came up with a subject and I thought sounds great but I've got
nothing interesting to say on this and there's a little voice at the back of my head that's drowned
out by the shouting little demon the shame wizard that's saying mate you do this podcast because
you've got good things to say. People listen to you in all sorts of circumstances because you have
good things to say and you tend to say them very well and very articulately. You know I'm no genius
at this. I'm not about to get off of the job as a TV presenter or whatever. Quite frankly I'm only
okay at this but I'm better at it than many or perhaps most people are and I can use it to help
myself and other people because I find talking quite therapeutic and I think some people find
listening to people like me talking therapeutic and that makes me feel good. And from that I get
the opposite of the anxiety spiraling feedback loop. If I can bring some light by using the
ability that I have into someone else's world and relieve them of some of their burden I can't think
of a better way to use that ability. But I couldn't hear that sane voice. Only the shame
wizard sounding sane and logical and telling me I suck. Call it writer's block. Call it low self
esteem. Call it procrastination. Call it what you want. I stopped. I've talked about procrastination
before and I think procrastination and overthinking are very closely related but not quite the same
thing. With procrastination you're avoiding doing something usually by doing something else
which may or may not be productive. Whereas with overthinking you obsess over something you've got
to do. You can't seem to get it out of your head. You worry about it. You question it. You overanalyze
it. This in my mind is all more serious than perhaps it sounds. Unhealthy thought loops are
one of the main signs of pervasive unhealthy anxiety and depression and precisely what
therapies like CBT exist to combat. Sometimes this manifests as ruminating over a single thing.
Sometimes you ruminate about anything and everything. Either way your central nervous
system gets stuck in panic mode which triggers all sorts of other physical and psychological
effects most of which over time can cause lasting damage or worse. For creativity to be therapeutic
it needs to be relaxing or at least absorbing. If it's creating anxiety then it's exactly the
opposite of what it needs to do. Maybe you're not in a position to diffuse all your other worries
but getting on top of your creative anxieties will set you on a good path to do exactly that.
So what's the remedy for this? Well at the risk of sounding obvious it's to stop overthinking.
Now I know that's harder than it might seem and it's sort of a bit of a contradiction in terms
but I think the reality is you've just got to do something. Most specifically you've got to do
anything. The cure for overthinking is action and in many ways it doesn't matter what action
just so you progress somehow. My most common form of overthinking when it comes to art
is obsessing about coming up with a new idea. That next signature piece something that will dazzle.
Paradoxically this usually comes off the back of a prior success and is delivered with a flavour of
imposter syndrome. Where all my prior success is just accidents what if I never do anything worthy
again? The solution on such occasions is to do something else. That might sound a bit glib,
almost a bit defeatist but it's a bit like when you're trying to desperately remember something
or to solve some tricky problem. Sometimes you've just got to stop trying, go do something else,
sleep on it, then bam! The answer comes to you when you're doing something totally unrelated.
From a creative perspective I don't necessarily mean go do something completely different like
washing the car or whatever. You'll likely end up obsessing more. You need to do something absorbing
and preferably something creativity related that you can do while relaxing. You're not being lazy
or weak by doing this. It's just a part of the creative process and an essential one.
Creation should feel natural, intuitive. If you force it then your work will likely seem
forced to other people and you'll be eroding the joy that you naturally take from the process,
a feeling that will stay with you through future works. This stuff accumulates over time like dirt
and grit in an engine. Eventually the engine seizes up. But what if you don't come back to
the original project? Well unless you had committed to it then maybe it wasn't something you should
have been doing or maybe just not now. If you do come back to it you'll find yourself looking at
it with new eyes, a new perspective and renewed enthusiasm. Your anxiety is forgotten or perhaps
even woven into your work. And please don't start stressing about whatever you end up doing to
distract yourself. The point is to do something that you're comfortable with and that you enjoyed
doing even if it doesn't feel like much of a step forward. Well if you've committed to doing
something and the reason you're stuck in a loop is that you're afraid that you're going to deliver
something terrible. Perhaps you're already part way through a project and it's not panning out how
you thought. Now you're worried that you've got to go back to the client with something crap or
maybe nothing at all. This is when you need to check in on yourself and apply a bit of logical
thinking as well as taking a break from it. Sometimes it's worth taking stock of your
worldview from a probabilistic perspective and looking at it in a soberly and detached way.
Maybe you've agreed to paint a portrait of someone and this is a particular anxiety of
mine. I've messed up these once or twice in the past. You've agreed to make a portrait of someone's
beloved and it just doesn't go well. Well it's not a good look and it's a bit depressing and
embarrassing and it really knocks yourself confidence. Most of us have messed up a bit
in our professional lives or when we're dealing with other people. It's just part of life.
At times like this you've got to trust yourself. So maybe you have messed up in the past but how
many times have you nailed it? So if you've done say 50 portrait commissions in the past and one
of them went astray, that's the one in 50 chance of screwing it up which is pretty small odds of
you doing it again. The odds of flubbing it are actually much lower because once you've messed up
once you're not going to mess up in that way again and of course that was past you who is much less
capable and awesome than you are now. These things never go smoothly anyway. How many times have you
got halfway through a project and thought to yourself what is this ridiculous assemblage of
canine excrement only to go on and craft the masterwork? And as every author knows many works
need a couple of attempts to get it right. Every time any of this happens you learn from it, you
move on and you're better for it. There's a reason there's been 50 odd anxiety free works between the
last misdemeanor and now. You're damn good at this so just get on with it. It's like being afraid of
flying in case of plane crashes. As we all know many tens of thousands of flights happen every day
and there's a crash like once every couple of years. There's a lottery winning order probability
of getting on a plane that takes a dive. I put my foot through the floor of my first floor studio
a couple of weeks ago so I suggest that for me at least the act of creation is more perilous than
flying. So I think sometimes you've just got to take a step back and think about yourself and
your situation soberly and objectively and recognize that almost certainly you're being
too pessimistic and over awaiting the likelihoods of negative outcomes. And that's the core of all
of this. Anxiety happens when your brain loses track of the real likelihood of bad things happening.
Of course sometimes our problems are real but sometimes our worries about those real problems
bleed into other parts of our lives. So remember this, overthinking is a form of anxiety and as
rational and sensible as your ruminations and self-criticism seem they're just another symptom
of incipient anxiety and what better way to relieve anxiety than the act of creation.
So the question is did I end up overthinking this one too? Well I finished it which I guess counts
for something but perhaps it's for you to decide. On the subject of not overthinking I have a draft
of a second installment of my How to Be Creative series so maybe you'll see that next or maybe I'll
get distracted by something else. I guess we'll see. In other news I now have a shop on my artist
website so you can buy my original artworks directly from there. There's at least 70 pieces
up there at the moment and more coming all the time. That's on alexloveless.co.uk forward slash
shop and as ever if you like this tell at least one other person and if you want to support me
then I have a Patreon account at patreon.com forward slash alexloveless where you can sign
up with various different plans and support me financially otherwise I'll see you soon.
