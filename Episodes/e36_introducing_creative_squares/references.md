## Mathematical Concepts

### Core Mathematical Terms
- **Fibonacci Sequence** - 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21... (each number = sum of previous two)
- **Golden Ratio (Phi)** - 1.618033988... (distinct from Pi)
- **Pi** - Mathematical constant, comparison point for Phi
- **Sacred Geometry** - Mathematical principles underlying artistic composition
- **One-point Perspective** - Renaissance technique combined with golden ratio
- **Recursive Function** - Mathematical concept, Fibonacci as example

### Compositional Techniques
- **Rule of Thirds** - Standard compositional guideline, comparison to golden ratio
- **Golden Section** - Alternative name for golden ratio
- **Fibonacci Grid/Spiral** - Compositional overlay tool
- **Center-defined Composition** - Alternative to golden ratio composition
