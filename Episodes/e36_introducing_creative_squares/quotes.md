# Episode 36: Introducing Creative Squares - Significant Quotes

## Introduction and Purpose

> "Hi everybody, I've got something a little bit different for you this week. Some of you might remember episode 27 back in December where I interviewed my friend Mark Burden. It was a great conversation, we touched on all sorts of issues, but one of the things we kept coming back to was the intersection between art, science, technology and mathematics."

> "We enjoyed that conversation so much we got together and decided that we would start our own podcast that focused on exactly that, the intersection between art, science, technology and mathematics."

## Central Question

> "But are the Golden Ratio and other compositional paradigms merely a tyranny of conformity and an illusion of familiarity? That's what we're going to discuss today."

## Mathematical Foundation

> "When I think about Fibonacci I think about the natural forms in life and kind of like growth formations in nature, specifically plants. And Fibonacci is a number sequence that is defined by a series of numbers and I'll just reel them out 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. And you get the next number in the sequence by summing up the previous two."

> "So if you think about a rectangle, there's a particular proportion between the shorter side and the longer side that is harmonious and that relates to the the number phi."

## Natural Beauty and Artistic Theory

> "And I guess the theory here is that since the Fibonacci sequence is seen so frequently in in nature and in the real world, it has some sense of aesthetic beauty that is inherent within nature. I.e. we find nature beautiful. The Fibonacci sequence, the stroke the gum ratio turns up in nature a lot. And therefore, if you have your painting composition aligned with the golden ratio, then you draw a line between a comparison between your picture and the natural compositions in nature."

## Renaissance Application

> "And typically, this is where Leonardo and those early Renaissance paintings, so we're using one point perspective plus the golden ratio to define their compositions, to give it a feeling of naturalism, but also of purity and symbolic power and harmony by using this mathematical device."

## Mona Lisa Analysis

> "Yeah, that's right. The Mona Lisa is completely dominated by the Fibonacci sequence or the golden section. So it's amazing when you when you place on the Fibonacci grid to the Mona Lisa, you just find that almost every single aspect of the composition is based around an underlying mathematical, you know, sacred geometry or device."

## Harmony and Manipulation

> "So I think there's a kind of intuitive way in which the audience engages in the art that gives them a kind of like a home harmonious high. But it's also because of the harmony, because of our association with that harmony, it's something that gives a level of attraction that can be manipulated, I guess."

> "But also, as you kind of like hinted at, there's a level of tyranny to that particular aesthetic. If you've seen it too much, you just you may get a little bit bored with it, you know, may just all be a little bit too harmonious. And you don't think the world is quite like that. So it's not a reflection of our everyday reality in that sense."

## Skepticism and Confirmation Bias

> "But to jump from that to the Mona Lisa to the pyramids, you start to get a little bit of waft of confirmation bias because you can you can just take any, you know, any house, because houses certainly in this country are generally rectangular and and start to, you know, let's take this measurement to this measurement. Oh, no, that's not, you know, that's not the golden ratio. But if I take this measurement to this measurement, it is. Well, hold on, you know, that's not exactly a rigorous scientific process."

## Tool Album Example

> "American Prague metal band Tool recorded the whole album Lateralis that centers around the Fibonacci sequence in the beat and the structure of the songs in the album. So it definitely is there. But, you know, Lateralis is a hard listen, like it's a hard album to listen to. And it's really long and complicated and almost nothing repeats. Right. And and from that sense, you know, aesthetics or harmony, I'm not sure most people would say theming in a whole album around Fibonacci led to a more harmonious album."

## Cultural Conditioning

> "And we get a certain convergence because this is the paradigm or the standard way of composing pictures within a rectangle. And and so we get this self fulfilling thing that keeps going and going and going and to the point where when someone violates the rule, either the rule of thirds or the golden ratio or one of the others, people look at that and go, oh, that makes me uncomfortable. That's a bit weird. That's a bit off."

> "No, I mean, I think I think you're right. I mean, a lot of art is, it's based around this this idea of repetition. We're told what art is, we're told what it looks like. And in some ways, it's a kind of a meme that is kind of like manipulated through time. And therefore, if something looks a bit like art and smells a bit like art, then we we make a connection to say I think it's probably is art."

## Artists and Rule-Breaking

> "And then you've always always got artists throughout the history of art since the Renaissance anyway, you know, the one to just do something different. Oh, I don't like that. I can make it a bit more naturalistic. I can put a bit more shadow to this. I can make it a bit more exciting. I can give a different subject matter, blah, blah, blah. So there are always artists always change the rules and they hate rules, really. They like some of them some of the time. But if they get in the way, they want to get rid of them."

## AI and Homogeneity

> "But as we move into this area of AI generated work and mathematical patterns supporting, you know, a lot of the artificial intelligence and machine intelligence, then we have different philosophical questions about, you know, what's the nature of aesthetics? Are we creating a closed loop via the algorithms that machine intelligence is using to to continually generate like minded art?"

> "Now, those models have learned rightly or wrongly, that has learned from everything that is found on the internet, which includes probably a billion photo snaps, but a lot of images of the great masters of, you know, painters all through history, many of which will have used very standard compositional practices, which the machine is learning."

> "And therefore the more AI art that gets out there, the more homogeneity there's going to be around things like composition and structure. And it sort of, you get to this point where, you know, are we ever going to see anything that looks different ever again? And it's quite depressing in that sense."

## AI's Limitations

> "It's simply, they're not intelligence. The artificial intelligence moniker is a massive misnomer and that they're simply regurgitating and vomiting out stuff that they've seen before. And they're going to vomit out in roughly the way they've seen it before."

## Personal AI Experience

> "And what I found is that they, I have a way I want to do things. It's fairly specific to how I work and just how I learned those languages and so on, or how I write, how I write my blog posts or podcast episodes and things like that. And then so you get it. So can you write some code to do this? And it writes it in a certain way. And I'm like, no, I don't want it done that way. Right?"

> "And if you've ever done any programming, but it's the same with creative writing, it's an infinite way, number of ways to do anything. And, but it only wants to do it in the prevalent way."

## Rule-Breaking Value

> "One is that the flip side to the conformity is that if there are no rules to break, then you can't break any rules. And as you point out, artists like breaking rules. And making art isn't always about aesthetics and making things look pleasing. When you subvert the standards on composition and it makes people uncomfortable with it, then you probably meant them to feel uncomfortable."

## Intuitive Composition

> "And so how do you compose a, how do you compose a painting? Well, I, I'd move things around until it looks good to me. Right. Do you, you know, stick a grid across the canvas or something? No, I don't. Right."

> "It's always been intuitive to me. Now someone will come in this house and, you know, mathematically analyze all my paintings and tell me that, Oh no, they're all Fibonacci. You know what I mean? They're all absolutely, you must be some sort of genius because they're all absolutely perfect golden ratio. But I certainly have never used it."

## Recursive Patterns

> "Well, that's it, right? So you've got a pattern within a pattern within a pattern, you got turtles all the way down. There's something specifically recursive about this conversation. And, you know, the Fibonacci is a recursive function."

## Final Caution

> "So I think, you know, we need to be a little bit careful about how pervasive Fibonacci in the golden section is in the natural world, and cautious in terms of its interpretation. And, you know, a level of bias in in our history, whether that's traditional or, you know, this kind of new stuff that's coming out of machines."
