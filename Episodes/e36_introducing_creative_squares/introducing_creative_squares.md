Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. Hi everybody, I've got something a little bit
different for you this week. Some of you might remember episode 27 back in December where I
interviewed my friend Mark Burden. It was a great conversation, we touched on all sorts of issues,
but one of the things we kept coming back to was the intersection between art, science, technology
and mathematics. We enjoyed that conversation so much we got together and decided that we would
start our own podcast that focused on exactly that, the intersection between art, science,
technology and mathematics. We've done that and our first episode has just been published.
The podcast is called Creative Squares and it can be found wherever you find your podcast.
So this week I'm going to share episode one of Creative Squares for your delectation.
If you like it go and follow it, rate it, review it and share it on all your usual places and
more episodes will come. I'm not sure what sort of schedule this is going to go on. We're still
finding our feed, it's still early days, but if you subscribe to it the next episode will just pop
into your feed when it comes out. So without further ado here's the first episode. It's called
the Golden Ratio, Aesthetic Alchemy or Creative Conformity and we discuss the Golden Ratio,
what it means, what it is, how it's derived, how it's used and we take a slightly critical view
on its place in culture, the arts and mathematics. I'm really pleased with this and I really hope you
enjoy it and I'll be back soon with a normal episode. Thank you.
Welcome to Creative Squares where we discuss the intersection between art, science, maths and
technology. I'm Alex Loveless. I'm Mark Burden. To kick off this podcast we're getting to cover
one of the most well-known art maths crossovers. The Golden Ratio aka the Golden Section aka Phi
1.618-033-9877 etc. The reason this is such a great starting point for this podcast is it turns up
not only in maths and art but in biology, engineering, architecture, computing, music and points towards
Renaissance, Da Vinci, Dali, Dan Brown and presumably some other folks with names that don't start with
DA. But are the Golden Ratio and other compositional paradigms merely a tyranny of conformity and an
illusion of familiarity? That's what we're going to discuss today. But before we do let's
refamiliarize ourselves with what the Golden Ratio actually is. To understand the Golden Ratio
you first need to understand something called the Fibonacci Sequence. Mark, do you want to take us
through what that is and why it's important? When I think about Fibonacci I think about
the natural forms in life and kind of like growth formations in nature, specifically plants. And
Fibonacci is a number sequence that is defined by a series of numbers and I'll just reel them out
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. And you get the next number in the sequence by summing up the previous
two. So in this case we get the first two numbers in the sequence 1 plus 1 and then we sum them up
to get the third number which equals 2. And then to get the next number in the sequence we sum up
2 plus 1 to give us 3. And then we get 3 plus 2 equals 5 and so on. So we get an infinite number
series based around integers and it just carries on like that. And when we think about how that
could be reflected in nature, you know, if we look at simple things like the formation of a tree,
going from its main trunk to all of the little twigs and branches right at the end, it follows
more or less a kind of like Fibonacci sequence where the main trunks get broken into two and
then into three and so forth. And you end up with loads of little twiglets and bits at the end that
you know in springtime transform into leaves. Yeah, absolutely. And we see it on the petals of
flowers tend to be one of one or other of the Fibonacci numbers and it turns up in all sorts
of weird places. I think people see it almost everywhere. It's one of those numbers that
mathematicians get quite excited about, a bit like pi and prime numbers and want to know as much about
as possible. But how does that the Fibonacci sequence relate to the golden ratio? A good question
and in fact it's to do with the way in which the proportions are built out. So if you think about a
rectangle, there's a particular proportion between the shorter side and the longer side
that is harmonious and that relates to the the number phi. So if you take one side and divide
it by the other side, you'll get the number phi, which is different from pi and very easy to confuse
the two if you're not used to phi and pi. But phi is that number, the 1.618 dot dot dot, which is
a regular number and is as long as pi. But yeah, it's that ratio. So it creates a kind of like
harmonious balance when you're looking at those two aspects on a rectangle. So shorter side versus
longer side and it's the proportion of which when you're looking at the two, it creates this level
of harmony that we see in nature. So we have this rectangular shape with a spiral inside there
that has been used most notably by people like Leonardo da Vinci, but many, many others
to aid composition of pictures and paintings. And I guess the theory here is that since
the Fibonacci sequence is seen so frequently in in nature and in the real world,
it has some sense of aesthetic beauty that is inherent within nature. I.e. we find nature
beautiful. The Fibonacci sequence, the stroke the gum ratio turns up in nature a lot. And therefore,
if you have your painting composition aligned with the golden ratio, then
you draw a line between a comparison between your picture and the natural compositions in nature.
And behind all of that, we have this mathematical construct, the sequence called the Fibonacci
sequence. Yeah, you're spot on there, Alex. And again, you know, when we think about the way in
which the rectangle for the golden ratio that we were used to seeing in in fine art and in
compositional devices for fine art, it's made up of those series of squares, you know, so you get
the one plus one creates another square of two, two plus two, and that creates another square of
three plus three and five plus five. And then we get the square of eight plus eight. So you've got
within this proportion rectangle a number of focal points, which is different from what we
potentially get with just a standard square. And I know that we both compose our art a lot of the
time in terms of standard square. And the thing about the square is there's really only one center
of focus, which tends to be the central point. But with the spiral shape, which is inherent
in the Fibonacci series and the golden ratio, you get different points of interest. And typically,
this is where Leonardo and those early Renaissance paintings, so we're using one point perspective
plus the golden ratio to define their compositions, to give it a feeling of naturalism, but also
of purity and symbolic power and harmony by using this mathematical device. So I think it's
kind of interesting that it was rediscovered by Fibonacci from other sources. And then it was
used in the Renaissance to kind of create a different type of aesthetic that was supposedly
more harmonious. But we can see that the proportions were used in a lot of temple building
and important buildings of power, these defined proportions that create a kind of a sense of
harmony and a sense of power. Yeah, absolutely. And so I think Fibonacci didn't discover this
sequence. It's been known about in various parts of the world for millennia. He was simply the
person who popularized it in Europe, and it was instrumental in kicking off the Renaissance.
He popularized quite a lot of other concepts at that time as well. And a lot of this thinking
came from the East, Asia, Islamic, science and mathematics. It supposedly turns up in
architecture. And it's been theorized that it was used in the construction of the Great Pyramids.
For example, in Giza, which is a somewhat tenuous assertion, as far as I understand.
We're getting to ancient alien territory here, but it turns up all over the place. And
it tends to be a way to make things feel harmonious and to fit in with a natural
sense of proportion and construction. And I think it's not dramatically different in some
senses from like some of the other compositional rules, like the rule of thirds and the sort of
the classic art school or even just school, art class at school, diktats around. If you're
painting someone or drawing a picture of someone as a portrait, don't have them dead center
staring out at you. Right. If you've got a vase of flowers and some other bits and you want to
create a composition where the vase of flowers is slightly offset to the side. And these
compositionally make a certain amount of sense, although you can find exceptions
absolutely everywhere for these. I immediately thought as soon as I said the vase of flowers,
well, thank off the sunflowers are dead center as far as I remember.
I broadly sort of agree with that. But the whole mystique that goes with the golden ratio is sort
of something that transcends simple compositional rules. And and at not least the likes of Dan Brown
and his Da Vinci code and all the conspiracy theory stuff that happens around that.
That, you know, that people when they see the golden ratio or they think they see the golden
ratio in use, then there's something more deeply symbolic going on than simply, oh,
don't place things dead center. For example, the Mona Lisa, right? Has the has that composition?
Yeah, that's right. The Mona Lisa is completely dominated by the Fibonacci sequence or the golden
section. So it's amazing when you when you place on the Fibonacci grid to the Mona Lisa,
you just find that almost every single aspect of the composition is based around an underlying
mathematical, you know, sacred geometry or device. Is that the case of so if you've got the the
Fibonacci square with the spiral with the the down point of the spiral downward, so you're
looking at it from a portrait perspective, would Mona Lisa's face be where the middle of the spiral
is? Is that what we're saying here? It's pretty much like that. If I remember correctly, yes.
And so I'm actually looking at the portrait behind my head there. That's one of my it's not really a
portrait. It's just a painting. One of my paintings actually, I don't think that's an
appropriately proportioned rectangle, rectangular painting. But I suspect that that is almost
Fibonacci-ish where I've put her face there, right? Which is which is not in fact, there's two of them.
Look, the other side of my head, they're both sort of in that same place. And so most historically,
when people have been doing portraits, that they tend to sit like Mona Lisa does. Right.
So I don't see a massive I mean, you know, you can you can put the Fibonacci
spiral on that and have it roughly at her in the middle of the face. But what else is it? Is there
more going on there than that? I think that's interesting. I mean, I think there was, you know,
especially when you look at the early Renaissance, a lot of the paintings are based around
the underlying mathematical principle of composition. So Benini or any of the the
North European artists were kind of like contemporaries of Leonardo and Michelangelo
and Raphael were also using that as a compositional device. And so then it was it's more than just
how we frame a portrait. It's it's to do with the fact that it was an idea of, let's make this a
harmonious experience, even if we're depicting something that is more difficult to digest, which
in some ways, you know, some of the Christian iconography, you know, was some of some of the
Renaissance paintings that relate to Christian iconography, the shooting of St. Sebastian shot
to pieces with arrows and stuff like that. There's a there's a level of violence in the image.
And yet at the same time, there's a harmonious composition that allows you to contemplate
that level of violence or level of martyrdom, if you want to look at it from that perspective.
So I think there's a kind of intuitive way in which the audience engages in the art
that gives them a kind of like a home harmonious high. But it's also because of the harmony,
because of our association with that harmony, it's something that gives a level of attraction that
can be manipulated, I guess. And that that's kind of interesting in one sense. But also,
as you kind of like hinted at, there's a level of tyranny to that particular aesthetic. If you've
seen it too much, you just you may get a little bit bored with it, you know, may just all be a
little bit too harmonious. And you don't think the world is quite like that. So it's not a reflection
of our everyday reality in that sense. Well, not there at all. Right. And so there's no there's
no hard and fast rules that the number of petals on on flowers tends to be they tend to be Fibonacci
numbers. Although there's some various theories about the fact why that what why if it really is a
pattern, why that might be because apparently the Fibonacci sequence is quite a good way,
quite an efficient way of packing things in. So seeds within flowers often follow
roughly some sort of Fibonacci like rule. And you can see that from the way that the golden ratio
rectangle is divided up. It's an extremely efficient way of packing things. So it's not
beyond the realms of credulity that over billions of years nature found certain ways of
maximizing for for space and efficiency, because that's simply what natural selection does. So I
can get for one point where, yeah, OK, maybe that there's a rule, a general rule around, you know,
flower petals and Fibonacci and maybe Fibonacci turns up more often than would be represented
by pure chance. But to jump from that to the Mona Lisa to the pyramids, you start to get a little
bit of waft of confirmation bias because you can you can just take any, you know, any house,
because houses certainly in this country are generally rectangular and and start to,
you know, let's take this measurement to this measurement. Oh, no, that's not, you know,
that's not the golden ratio. But if I take this measurement to this measurement, it is. Well,
hold on, you know, that's not exactly a rigorous scientific process. And and so,
you know, I'm not massively convinced that the golden section is different from the
rule of thirds in any dramatic way. And I'm not massively convinced it it it's it's actually there
where people say it is. Now, the flip side to that is that we know it's in DaVinci's paintings
because he told us, right. We know apparently it's in Bach, some of Bach's compositions,
American Prague metal band Tool recorded the whole album Lateralis that centers around the Fibonacci
sequence in the beat and the structure of the songs in the album. So it definitely is there.
But, you know, Lateralis is a hard listen, like it's a hard album to listen to. And it's really
long and complicated and almost nothing repeats. Right. And and from that sense, you know,
aesthetics or harmony, I'm not sure most people would say theming in a whole album around
Fibonacci led to a more harmonious album. I think most people will argue the exact opposite,
unless, of course, you're a tool fan. So, I mean, that's my question. Is it really improving things?
You know what I mean? Or is it just a convention that has emerged and has attached to it a
slightly higher degree of emphasis? Yeah, I mean, I think it's one of those things that people get
interested in and then they push it back and say, oh, it's a bit old fashioned,
we'll do something else. But within the history of art, it's one of those things that people seem
to keep going back to. You know, it's a source of interest and curiosity, and you use it and then
you maybe put it in the bin for a while or it goes out of fashion. And you end up having a different
focus. But I think you mentioned when we were chatting before about, you know, the abstract
compositions of Mondrian. And again, you know, if you look at those compositions, you think, well,
they're just abstract, they're quite pleasant. But when you do the analysis, you find out that
they're based around, you know, a lot of golden section proportions within the canvas. So whether
that's something that happened intuitively, or whether that's something that was kind of like
pre-programmed and pre-designed and pre-composed, just different question. I was very interested
in looking at Marcel Duchamp's large glass, this kind of like techno image of intelligent,
emotional machines interacting with each other. And again, you know, I wasn't aware that he would
ever use something like the golden ratio. But in all of the drawings he did, which are the precursor
to the large glass, he was using the golden ratio. And so that whole composition, not usually
mentioned in a lot of the art historical literature around the large glass, is completely based around
the golden section. And I mean, he said it was kind of like a mechanical approach to doing art.
But it's interesting that that was a kind of like a level of aesthetic that he was using,
crops up everywhere. And then you think, oh, no, this is just too much bias. And no,
I don't want my stuff to look like everyone else's. Well, and precisely, right. And so if we take
this sort of idea of the composition of the Mona Lisa, which is also just a fairly sensible
and pleasing composition for any waist up portrait for your average school photo. Right.
And and that's cool. Right. And I don't really think that that paradigm needs to be massively
disrupted. But then you get this idea that why is it like that? Well, this person did it before,
who copied this person did it for who copied this person who did it before. And some of them
may have been aware of the compositional imposition of the of the golden ratio.
But most people were just sort of going, well, when I see portraits, this is what they look like.
I based my work on X on Mondrian. And and therefore, when you look at it, you'll find
that there's some golden ratio in there. And we get a certain convergence because this is the
paradigm or the standard way of composing pictures within a rectangle. And and so we get this
self fulfilling thing that keeps going and going and going and to the point where when someone
violates the rule, either the rule of thirds or the golden ratio or one of the others,
people look at that and go, oh, that makes me uncomfortable. That's a bit weird. That's a bit
off. But what's going on there? You know, there's this idea that, oh, no, we have these compositions
because we see them naturally in nature. But I don't think that's at all clear. I don't think
that's at all a done deal. And therefore, are they only uncomfortable simply because they're used to
seeing things in that composition, the artificial things in that composition and actually had
Da Vinci decided to use some other method of composition that everyone at this point would
be going, oh, look, there's Mona Lisa, as we always see us, you know, doing a headstand or something.
No, I mean, I think I think you're right. I mean, a lot of art is, it's based around this this idea
of repetition. We're told what art is, we're told what it looks like. And in some ways, it's a kind
of a meme that is kind of like manipulated through time. And therefore, if something looks a bit like
art and smells a bit like art, then we we make a connection to say I think it's probably is art.
And then you've always always got artists throughout the history of art since the Renaissance
anyway, you know, the one to just do something different. Oh, I don't like that. I can make it
a bit more naturalistic. I can put a bit more shadow to this. I can make it a bit more exciting.
I can give a different subject matter, blah, blah, blah. So there are always artists always change
the rules and they hate rules, really. They like some of them some of the time. But if they get in
the way, they want to get rid of them. And I think it's a bit the same with, you know, the harmonies
of the the golden section, the harmonies of Fibonacci, and the fact that there's a level of
tyranny to it as well. It makes you ask the question, can you have something beautiful? Can you have
something visually interesting and stimulating that is not the golden section? And of course,
the answer is yes. But as we move into this area of AI generated work and mathematical patterns
supporting, you know, a lot of the artificial intelligence and machine intelligence, then we
have different philosophical questions about, you know, what's the nature of aesthetics? Are we
creating a closed loop via the algorithms that machine intelligence is using to to continually
generate like minded art? So you know, something that has got the same DNA as its precursors. I
don't think it needs to be like that. But I think there may be algorithms in the background that
make these things that look like art and kind of smell like art, use these patterns to to to make
them more convincing and more appealing to human human vision and eyes and intellect.
There's quite a lot to unpack there. And we're not going to do it all today. There's definitely
some more. We may need another conversation. Might need another few hundred. But some points that
jump out. One is that the flip side to the conformity is that if there are no rules to break,
then you can't break any rules. And as you point out, artists like breaking rules. And making art
isn't always about aesthetics and making things look pleasing. When you subvert the standards on
composition and it makes people uncomfortable with it, then you probably meant them to feel
uncomfortable. Right. And the and if that's what you wanted, then that's that's a piece of art fit
for the purpose for which it was designed. And of course, there are always going to be just
very pure brute force statistics, a center ground, right, a more popular way of doing things. And so
that happens to be the Fibonacci sequence, the golden section, the rule of thirds and these
things. And could it have been different is an open question. Does it matter at this point?
Probably not, because that's where people have coalesced anyway. Right. Now, when you touch on
the whole thing, that's where things start to get mega thorny, because obviously you take something
like Dali or Mid Journey, one of these generative algorithms and models that produce images based on
text instructions, I give me a picture of a Volkswagen Beetle in the style of Van Gogh,
right, which it would probably do a decent enough job of and you probably weren't looking for a
great master work there anyway. Maybe just needed a graphic for your blog or something. Now,
those models have learned rightly or wrongly, that has learned from everything that is found on
the internet, which includes probably a billion photo snaps, but a lot of images of the great
masters of, you know, painters all through history, many of which will have used very standard
compositional practices, which the machine is learning. It's not learning in the sense that
knows what it's doing. It's simply saying, well, when I see pictures, they usually look like this.
So if you want to portrait, it's probably going to be roughly golden ratioed and then it all gets
compounded and everything starts to feel more and more homogenetic because these models can't be
creative. It's simply, they're not intelligence. The artificial intelligence moniker is a massive
misnomer and that they're simply regurgitating and vomiting out stuff that they've seen before. And
they're going to vomit out in roughly the way they've seen it before. And therefore the more
AI art that gets out there, the more homogeneity there's going to be around things like composition
and structure. And it sort of, you get to this point where, you know, are we ever going to see
anything that looks different ever again? And it's quite depressing in that sense.
Yeah, I know it's going to be interesting to see where it goes. I mean, the
AI generated art, I mean, it's a word prompt versus a visual prompt or a material prompt.
And that means that the work is generated. It doesn't have a level of materiality until
it's printed out or it forms into some form of 3D printing, I guess. You know, you can imagine
that something like that may happen in the not too distant future unless it probably happened
already because, you know, jewelry design is now being created by 3D printers and stuff like that.
So, you know, this whole mishmash of hybrid compositions by machines and humans is already
happening. I've been using large language models much more than I've used the image-based ones.
And I use them for either writing text as a bit of a shortcut. You know, I get them sometimes to
do coding for me in Python. And what I found is that they, I have a way I want to do things.
It's fairly specific to how I work and just how I learned those languages and so on, or how I write,
how I write my blog posts or podcast episodes and things like that. And then so you get it. So can
you write some code to do this? And it writes it in a certain way. And I'm like, no, I don't want it
done that way. Right? So you go into it and you say, well, no, no. Okay. Can you do it again,
but write it this way? And it doesn't want to, right? It's simply like, no, I can't do it that
way. Can only do it this way. Right? And if you've ever done any programming, but it's the same with
creative writing, it's an infinite way, number of ways to do anything. And, but it only wants to do
it in the prevalent way. Now, whether I'm right or wrong to want it be done differently, it's kind
of beside the point, just shut up and do what I told you. But it doesn't, it's not being belligerent.
It's just saying, I'm sorry, I just don't understand. You're going to have to have it done
this way because it's the only way. Right. And, and I, and I can see that with art, right. And,
and so by using AI to do things like design or even composition or anything like that for
artists using it for creating references for figure drawing or something, right.
You can't get it to compose it differently. It just is too much effort. And, and therefore,
like it is going to have that impact everywhere all over the place of driving this homogeneity of,
of composition and appearance of, of art. I just, it just seems very likely to me. And that's quite
sad. But also, if you want to stand out, then don't do it that way. Have square artworks,
for example, Mark. I think that could be very interesting. Yeah. I mean, I think the,
the challenge with square artworks is that you have to work harder at the compositions.
Well, I do. I love squares and I can see one there on my shoulder and I love,
my other favorite aspect ratio is two by one, which wherever way that is the, the, the portrait
version of two by one. Another one that forces you to do interesting stuff with compositions
and, and not something that you can easily apply Fibonacci to, although I'm all, I'm very likely
doing some version of the rule of thirds. It tends to be my go-to, but mostly I just do this
intuitively anyway. Right. And so how do you compose a, how do you compose a painting?
Well, I, I'd move things around until it looks good to me. Right. Do you, you know, stick a grid
across the canvas or something? No, I don't. Right. You know, sometimes I'll use them because
if I'm playing around with compositions within like I photo or something, it automatically
imposes a grid. It's sometimes quite helpful, especially if I want to get things centered,
ooh, which you're not supposed to do, which I do all the time. And it's a bit of a case of,
it's always been intuitive to me. Now someone will come in this house and, you know, mathematically
analyze all my paintings and tell me that, Oh no, they're all Fibonacci. You know what I mean?
They're all absolutely, you must be some sort of genius because they're all absolutely perfect
golden ratio. But I certainly have never used it. Have you? No, I've always found it too difficult.
It's never worked for me. So I'm, I'm very intuitive in terms of the way that I
construct compositions. But if I'm looking at historical paintings, I'm amazed by how much of
the underlying composition can be based around the golden section. So that, that for me has been
an interesting insight. Certainly over the course of the last few years, just to look at the
compositions and notice how much of them are based around these mathematical proportions.
And the question that you, you hint out there, Alex is, you know, are we going with this new
machine intelligence world that we're creating or the machines are creating themselves?
You know, are we going to see more of those mathematical patterns in terms of
output or a processing power to that, that overall composition? And I think artists can then decide
whether they want to use them or whether they just rely on their intuition and their visual,
their visual skills to be able to balance things out, whether it's a center,
center defined composition or whether it's not. But I think there's a lot of things that humans
do intuitively that machines find incredibly difficult to do. But there's certainly something
in there in terms of watch this space, you know, how is it going to involve? What's our relationship
to that involvement? You know, are we going to be doing more stuff that's hybrid? Are we going to do
more stuff that's completely intuitive and doesn't look anything naturally like Fibonacci, but may
still have that Fibonacci element to it when someone comes along and analyzes it later?
Well, that's it, right? So you've got a pattern within a pattern within a pattern, you got
turtles all the way down. There's something specifically recursive about this conversation.
And, you know, the Fibonacci is a recursive function. And so is it there? Well, we know that
pi is there, right? Pi is there because every time you see a circle, that's pi, right? There's
not there's no ambiguity about this. The Fibonacci sequence definitely exists because you can do it.
And it can be extrapolated to, you know, pretty extreme lengths. But is it there in nature?
It's less clear, right? But we assume that it is. And as you sort of zoom out in a
sort of fractal sense, yes, maybe you do see it in a lot more places. And maybe
it depends on your lens and your zoom level on sort of human culture and which particular
features you zoom in on. Maybe it's much more present and cynics like me can just shut the
hell up. But I'm being a bit of devil's advocate here because I because it's an interesting
conversation, right? And I tend to be quite skeptical by nature. And I tend to quite like
pushing against people with things that to me resemble conspiracy theories or or just generally
finding patterns where they probably don't exist. But also, large case, I just don't care, right?
I think it's an interesting subject. But I just don't have any use for it. And so I can sort of
take any stance I want on this one. But I'll probably keep being somewhat cynical about the
whole thing until someone proves to me more more concretely. But on the math side, what is how
this whole journals written on the Fibonacci sequence. So I suspect there's much more to be
found there. And I do wonder whether there's certain ways you can line up the Fibonacci numbers
and create something aesthetically pleasing that way. But I'm sure someone's tried it.
Probably have. I mean, and again, you know, we may find with the images, rather than the portraits
that you do the images that you use the head, you probably find that there's a level of Fibonacci
just in terms of the proportions of different different aspects of the head, you know,
relationship, the eyes to the nose to the mouth and chin and forehead and so forth. You know,
there's probably something there. But, you know, I don't think that's the meaning of the work you're
doing. It's just inherent in the fact that you're using a representational image of a head. So I
think, you know, we need to be a little bit careful about how pervasive Fibonacci in the
golden section is in the natural world, and cautious in terms of its interpretation. And,
you know, a level of bias in in our history, whether that's traditional or, you know, this
kind of new stuff that's coming out of machines. Well, chicken and egg, right. And now you're
going to tell me the egg is somehow in the shape of Fibonacci or something. I'm sure it is.
I'm sure it is. I believe it today. So I don't buy any of your criticism. Right. I think probably
we'll wrap this one up. I know we could have gone deeper on any number of aspects on this.
And I and the reason we're not doing that is simply because we know we're going to have to
come back to it. Whether we do more episodes on the Fibonacci and the golden section or whether
it just turns up, you know, I'll be astounded if we don't do something on the Renaissance
and delve down on more of the Vinci stuff. And, you know, we've got to talk about the last supper
and all that type of thing. This stuff is going to come back up again. So we will definitely
revisit, but probably won't be for a little while. But I think I think we're done. So
thank you for joining us today. And we'll see you again soon. Bye.
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for your time and thanks for listening and being engaged.
If you have any questions, let us know.
