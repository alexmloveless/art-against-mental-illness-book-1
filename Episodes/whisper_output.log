[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Nobody can miss them for me
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.000]  That's reason why I try both
[00:13.000 --> 00:20.000]  If all is old, I can see a thousand times all day
[00:20.000 --> 00:27.000]  Out against mental illness
[00:50.000 --> 00:58.000]  If all is old, I can see a thousand times all day
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.000]  You humans wouldn't know real art if it walked up and poked you in your woefully inadequate vision organs
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  Did you know that Shakespeare's plays were actually written by a hyper-intelligent smear of oily gunk that rode to earth on a meteor?
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  Not even as creative as oily gunk, I ask you
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  You couldn't make it up
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  Well you lot bloody well couldn't that's for sure
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  Only joking, I'm still here
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  As you can tell I've been having some fun with AI
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  I'll come back to that in a minute
[01:51.000 --> 01:58.000]  This is one of my occasional therapeutic outlet episodes where I let myself range a little bit more freely
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  And talk about things I want to talk about
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  And this one is about changes because I've had some changes again in my life
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  This time a little bit more positive
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  And so I wanted to talk about changes in general
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  And one of those changes, as the Alex Bot says
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  I just got a contract that came in out of nowhere
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  So I've got some work for the first time in a while
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  And I started pretty much immediately
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.000]  So I'm working now
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  So that immediately posed a problem for me
[02:29.000 --> 02:36.000]  With regards to how to continue my increasing portfolio of podcasts
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  Which will take quite a while to write, record and edit and publish
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  And so I'm looking for ways to try and make that a little bit easier
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  Because I really don't want to stop doing this
[02:49.000 --> 02:56.000]  And so I obviously got sucked down an AI rabbit hole as I tend to do
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  Which was of limited success
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  But I did have fun doing it
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  And that included using a large language model to build an Alex Bot
[03:06.000 --> 03:14.000]  Which essentially is supposed to emulate the way that I write in my voice
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  In my writing voice, using my vernacular and my opinions
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  And way of stating things
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  Which is okay
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  And also when I was doing that I thought it would be great if obviously it could do it in my voice as well
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  And I remembered the app that I used to record and edit this
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  Which is called Descript
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  Has an AI voice function so it can clone a voice
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  You can have it
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  You can have stuff read in in all sorts of fairly decent
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  Who the completely sympathetic voice is
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  But this one claims to be able to clone my voice
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  And that's what you heard
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  Which I think is quite interesting
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  It makes me sound like Marvin the paranoid android
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  And hence the whole Alex Bot spiel that you heard there
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  It's quite disturbing to hear yourself
[04:15.000 --> 04:24.000]  I mean I wonder who it is that's using these things to actually record podcasts and publish them
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  But maybe you think that sounds exactly like me
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  I hope I've got a little bit more life in me than that
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  But good on Alex Bot
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.000]  And if he really is going to take over my life in the world then better Alex Bot than someone else Bot, right?
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  So I actually wrote the script for that Alex Bot section
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  But obviously I created an Alex Writing Bot too
[04:47.000 --> 04:55.000]  So what happens when I get Alex Writing Bot and Alex Narrating Bot to work together
[04:55.000 --> 05:02.000]  And so I asked it to write a small piece of Art Against Mental Illness themed text
[05:02.000 --> 05:12.000]  So I asked Alex Bot to give me less than a hundred words on using creativity to manage change in your life
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  And this is what it gave me
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.000]  So creativity, using it to cope with life's curvy balls
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  Well I reckon it's like this, life throws shit at you, right? Changes upheavals the whole shebang
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  Now you can either sit there and let it bury you or you can grab a brush, a pen, a guitar, whatever
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  And start making something out of the mess
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  For me Art's always been that escape route, that way to channel the chaos into something else
[05:41.000 --> 05:47.000]  It's not about ignoring the bad stuff but about finding a way to process it, to tell a story with it
[05:47.000 --> 05:53.000]  And sometimes that story ends up being bloody beautiful, even if it started out as a right disaster
[05:53.000 --> 06:00.000]  So yeah, creativity, lifesaver mate, a few more mentally healthy people in the world can't be a bad thing, right?
[06:02.000 --> 06:08.000]  Well that was all the fun, wasn't it? Would I actually say it like that? Ish
[06:08.000 --> 06:13.000]  Yeah, it doesn't really sound like me, but fine
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.000]  I don't think he'll be taking over for me anytime soon, but perhaps you think he should
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.000]  Answers on the postcard, send them to your recycling bin
[06:23.000 --> 06:29.000]  Anyway, back to my wonderfully exciting life
[06:29.000 --> 06:35.000]  I've been in a bit of stasis for quite a long time now
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  I'm not going to recount the whole history of it
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  There are plenty of prior episodes that document my sorry story
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.000]  But I haven't worked for a while, and we've been running out of money
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.000]  And it's been really hard to see past this
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  That nothing seemed to be changing
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  I was really struggling to find work
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  Having assumed that it would be easy for me in my day job as a data scientist
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  People like me have been very much in demand, but I'm in the UK
[07:13.000 --> 07:20.000]  The UK trashed its own economy and continues to do so
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  And so investment I think has been quite low
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  And businesses haven't been taking risks
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  And as an independent contractor like me, companies were not employing us
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  And I know it's not just me
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  There are quite a few other people I know in my area who've really struggled too
[07:41.000 --> 07:51.000]  And so it became really difficult for me to envision a future past
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.000]  This continuing fugue state that I've been in
[07:56.000 --> 08:02.000]  And as money dwindled and hope sort of leaked away
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  Using my creativity to try and buoy me up
[08:05.000 --> 08:12.000]  But at the back of my mind, constantly worrying that I mean this was it, right?
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  Maybe my day job career is over
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000]  Maybe I've got to try something completely different
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  The art and creativity side of my world doesn't really earn me any money either
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  And you start to feel really worthless
