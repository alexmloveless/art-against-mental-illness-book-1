[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Nobody can miss them for me
[00:06.000 --> 00:10.000]  That's reason why I try both
[00:13.000 --> 00:20.000]  If all is old, I can see a thousand times all day
[00:20.000 --> 00:27.000]  Out against mental illness
[00:50.000 --> 00:58.000]  If all is old, I can see a thousand times all day
[01:21.000 --> 01:27.000]  You humans wouldn't know real art if it walked up and poked you in your woefully inadequate vision organs
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  Did you know that Shakespeare's plays were actually written by a hyper-intelligent smear of oily gunk that rode to earth on a meteor?
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  Not even as creative as oily gunk, I ask you
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  You couldn't make it up
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  Well you lot bloody well couldn't that's for sure
[01:44.000 --> 01:46.000]  Only joking, I'm still here
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  As you can tell I've been having some fun with AI
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  I'll come back to that in a minute
[01:51.000 --> 01:58.000]  This is one of my occasional therapeutic outlet episodes where I let myself range a little bit more freely
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  And talk about things I want to talk about
[02:01.000 --> 02:07.000]  And this one is about changes because I've had some changes again in my life
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  This time a little bit more positive
[02:09.000 --> 02:12.000]  And so I wanted to talk about changes in general
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  And one of those changes, as the Alex Bot says
[02:16.000 --> 02:18.000]  I just got a contract that came in out of nowhere
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.000]  So I've got some work for the first time in a while
[02:21.000 --> 02:25.000]  And I started pretty much immediately
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.000]  So I'm working now
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  So that immediately posed a problem for me
[02:29.000 --> 02:36.000]  With regards to how to continue my increasing portfolio of podcasts
[02:36.000 --> 02:42.000]  Which will take quite a while to write, record and edit and publish
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  And so I'm looking for ways to try and make that a little bit easier
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  Because I really don't want to stop doing this
[02:49.000 --> 02:56.000]  And so I obviously got sucked down an AI rabbit hole as I tend to do
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  Which was of limited success
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  But I did have fun doing it
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.000]  And that included using a large language model to build an Alex Bot
[03:06.000 --> 03:14.000]  Which essentially is supposed to emulate the way that I write in my voice
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  In my writing voice, using my vernacular and my opinions
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  And way of stating things
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  Which is okay
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  And also when I was doing that I thought it would be great if obviously it could do it in my voice as well
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  And I remembered the app that I used to record and edit this
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  Which is called Descript
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  Has an AI voice function so it can clone a voice
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  You can have it
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  You can have stuff read in in all sorts of fairly decent
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  Who the completely sympathetic voice is
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  But this one claims to be able to clone my voice
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  And that's what you heard
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  Which I think is quite interesting
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  It makes me sound like Marvin the paranoid android
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  And hence the whole Alex Bot spiel that you heard there
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  It's quite disturbing to hear yourself
[04:15.000 --> 04:24.000]  I mean I wonder who it is that's using these things to actually record podcasts and publish them
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  But maybe you think that sounds exactly like me
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  I hope I've got a little bit more life in me than that
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  But good on Alex Bot
[04:32.000 --> 04:38.000]  And if he really is going to take over my life in the world then better Alex Bot than someone else Bot, right?
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  So I actually wrote the script for that Alex Bot section
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  But obviously I created an Alex Writing Bot too
[04:47.000 --> 04:55.000]  So what happens when I get Alex Writing Bot and Alex Narrating Bot to work together
[04:55.000 --> 05:02.000]  And so I asked it to write a small piece of Art Against Mental Illness themed text
[05:02.000 --> 05:12.000]  So I asked Alex Bot to give me less than a hundred words on using creativity to manage change in your life
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.000]  And this is what it gave me
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.000]  So creativity, using it to cope with life's curvy balls
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  Well I reckon it's like this, life throws shit at you, right? Changes upheavals the whole shebang
[05:27.000 --> 05:33.000]  Now you can either sit there and let it bury you or you can grab a brush, a pen, a guitar, whatever
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  And start making something out of the mess
[05:36.000 --> 05:41.000]  For me Art's always been that escape route, that way to channel the chaos into something else
[05:41.000 --> 05:47.000]  It's not about ignoring the bad stuff but about finding a way to process it, to tell a story with it
[05:47.000 --> 05:53.000]  And sometimes that story ends up being bloody beautiful, even if it started out as a right disaster
[05:53.000 --> 06:00.000]  So yeah, creativity, lifesaver mate, a few more mentally healthy people in the world can't be a bad thing, right?
[06:02.000 --> 06:08.000]  Well that was all the fun, wasn't it? Would I actually say it like that? Ish
[06:08.000 --> 06:13.000]  Yeah, it doesn't really sound like me, but fine
[06:13.000 --> 06:18.000]  I don't think he'll be taking over for me anytime soon, but perhaps you think he should
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.000]  Answers on the postcard, send them to your recycling bin
[06:23.000 --> 06:29.000]  Anyway, back to my wonderfully exciting life
[06:29.000 --> 06:35.000]  I've been in a bit of stasis for quite a long time now
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  I'm not going to recount the whole history of it
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  There are plenty of prior episodes that document my sorry story
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.000]  But I haven't worked for a while, and we've been running out of money
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.000]  And it's been really hard to see past this
[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  That nothing seemed to be changing
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  I was really struggling to find work
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  Having assumed that it would be easy for me in my day job as a data scientist
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  People like me have been very much in demand, but I'm in the UK
[07:13.000 --> 07:20.000]  The UK trashed its own economy and continues to do so
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  And so investment I think has been quite low
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  And businesses haven't been taking risks
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  And as an independent contractor like me, companies were not employing us
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  And I know it's not just me
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  There are quite a few other people I know in my area who've really struggled too
[07:41.000 --> 07:51.000]  And so it became really difficult for me to envision a future past
[07:51.000 --> 07:56.000]  This continuing fugue state that I've been in
[07:56.000 --> 08:02.000]  And as money dwindled and hope sort of leaked away
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  Using my creativity to try and buoy me up
[08:05.000 --> 08:12.000]  But at the back of my mind, constantly worrying that I mean this was it, right?
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  Maybe my day job career is over
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000]  Maybe I've got to try something completely different
[08:20.000 --> 08:26.000]  The art and creativity side of my world doesn't really earn me any money either
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  And you start to feel really worthless
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  And you've got no value in society
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  Now I'm not going to get lost down the rabbit hole of why
[08:38.000 --> 08:43.000]  That it's completely bonkers that we have imposed on ourselves
[08:43.000 --> 08:52.000]  This capitalist regime that demands that your personal worth in the world, in the universe, to the human race
[08:52.000 --> 08:55.000]  Is tied to your ability to earn money
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.000]  But that's the reality of the society that I live in
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  And it's very easy to become despondent
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  And lose your self-esteem
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  And to become hopeless
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  And I've been a lot better
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.000]  I've had some extremely profound mental health problems over the last year and longer
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  And I've been a lot better recently
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.000]  Partly due to chemical interventions
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.000]  And partly due to me just getting past the worst of my problems
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  And getting my situation and burying myself in all sorts of really fun creative activities
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  Not least recording a podcast
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  And my life was sort of simmering away like that for quite a while
[09:53.000 --> 10:00.000]  And the anxiety and that sense of helplessness doesn't go away
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  I just managed to push it back a bit into the background
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  It was just a sort of background noise like tinnitus
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  But like tinnitus it's always there
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  And every time you stop thinking about something else
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  You hear the tinnitus, you hear the ringing
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  It's always there and it's really, really grinding
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  It's like having a stone in your shoe
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  I always kept the hope up though
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  And tried to keep the hope up for my family and the people around me
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  Because I knew that things can just change in a second
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  And it's frustrating because knowing that you sort of sit there going
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  Well can't you just change now? How about now?
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  And you're sort of trying to will circumstances to change
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  And obviously there's some stuff you can do about that
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  And that's precisely the problem
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.000]  All the things that I thought I needed to do
[11:01.000 --> 11:05.000]  All the things that people told me to do, they weren't working
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.000]  And I was running out of ideas as to how to change my situation
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  And it started to sort of learn helplessness
[11:15.000 --> 11:20.000]  And just sort of bed in for the long term
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  But I always knew that things could change at any minute
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  And that's sometimes very comforting
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  And other times it's just cold comfort
[11:31.000 --> 11:37.000]  It's like you're pouring out your heart to someone or your problems
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  And they go there, there, it's all going to get better
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  Things will be better and you're like, yeah, great, thanks
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  How does that help me right now?
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  And it sort of does and it sort of doesn't
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  And so it was really a waiting game
[11:51.000 --> 11:55.000]  I wasn't doing nothing to try and change my circumstances
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.000]  It's just that my avenues just kept drying up
[11:59.000 --> 12:04.000]  And then a couple of weeks ago out of nowhere
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  And an old colleague is actually, previously my boss's boss
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  A job that I did a decade ago
[12:13.000 --> 12:20.000]  Got in touch and says, you know, I've got a client, he runs a consultancy
[12:20.000 --> 12:25.000]  He said, I've got a client that needs some of exactly what you do
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  And they need it right now
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  And are you free?
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  And I was like, well, let me check my diary
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.000]  And I checked my diary and there was nothing in it, funnily enough, at all
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  And I was like, well, yeah, of course
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  I'm totally available
[12:41.000 --> 12:47.000]  I tried not to sound too excited or either enthusiastic
[12:47.000 --> 12:51.000]  Like a little puppy barking at his ankles
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.000]  And we didn't even need to do interviews or anything
[12:57.000 --> 13:01.000]  I knew this guy knows me of old and knows what I do and what I'm capable of
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  And just went and sold my work to his client
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  And they were like, well, we trust you, so we trust this guy
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  And so there we go
[13:10.000 --> 13:16.000]  It took a little bit longer than I'd originally thought, about a week longer
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  Which was quite nerve-wracking
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  You know, because the client could always have said no
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  And these things can always fall apart
[13:29.000 --> 13:36.000]  And as a long-term contractor, like a freelancer, if you would prefer
[13:36.000 --> 13:42.000]  I learned a very long time ago that you don't count the chickens
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  And in this case, you don't count on the money until at the very least
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  You've got the signed contract in your hands to say that we commit to pay you this money
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  And even then, it's no guarantee
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  But at that point, you can start to think, yeah, okay, this is happening
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  And so it took a little while for that to happen
[14:07.000 --> 14:14.000]  And not a lot longer at all, but in some ways it felt like an ice age
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  And then I was just working
[14:19.000 --> 14:27.000]  And it was really both absolutely bizarre and then totally normal at the same time
[14:28.000 --> 14:31.000]  Because I'm good at what I do
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  If you want to talk about it in terms of the 10,000 hours
[14:35.000 --> 14:42.000]  I've massively overshot the 10,000 hours needed for the expertise of what I do
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  And so I just slipped into it
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  It's like driving a car or riding a bike, I was just doing it again
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  And I had some anxiety that I would have forgotten how to do all of it
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  Which I haven't, really
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.000]  There's a few slightly patchy areas that I needed to remind myself of
[15:01.000 --> 15:08.000]  But I was up and running and really enjoying myself remembering that I'm good at this
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  And also remembering that this has value, the work that I do
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  I'm not going to go into the job that I do, maybe one day
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  Maybe one day you want to hear it, but that's not really for this podcast
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  I have another podcast, if you want to know more about that
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  It's called The Confusion Matrix
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  It's me and my business partner, Pete Hodge
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  We discuss things about data science
[15:35.000 --> 15:37.000]  It's me and him just shooting the breeze
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  Having fun and talking about stuff that interests us in that arena
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  So go look for that anywhere you get your podcasts
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  I think we're on episode five now
[15:47.000 --> 15:52.000]  Another podcast that I have to find a way to keep running
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  Anyway, where did I digress from?
[15:56.000 --> 16:01.000]  So I was still good at this
[16:01.000 --> 16:05.000]  And it was just like I'd never stopped
[16:05.000 --> 16:11.000]  And it's been such a long time and that felt so weird to me that this is just like normal
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  And normal for good and normal for bad
[16:14.000 --> 16:19.000]  And getting back in the corporate world and remembering very, very quickly
[16:19.000 --> 16:23.000]  How challenging it can be
[16:23.000 --> 16:25.000]  Especially when you've got a brain like mine
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  But they're good people
[16:27.000 --> 16:29.000]  It's an interesting project
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.000]  The work's really challenging
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  And it's only for a few weeks at this point anyway
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  But those few weeks are going to make such a huge difference to my life
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  And it's given me a huge confidence boost
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  But sitting in front of the computer thinking
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  Well this is not normal
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  At this point I'd usually be in my workshop
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  Carving holes in bits of wood or something
[16:59.000 --> 17:03.000]  And sort of thinking how weird it was that it didn't really feel that weird
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.000]  And also thinking, well I was right about the stuff changing thing, wasn't I?
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.000]  But it takes a while for that, for the anxieties to go away
[17:13.000 --> 17:17.000]  And it takes a while for that feeling of dread to dissipate
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  And it still hasn't dissipated
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  I still sort of can't believe it and don't really believe it
[17:23.000 --> 17:29.000]  And indeed as a contractor the other not counting chickens thing is
[17:29.000 --> 17:38.000]  Not assuming you're home and dry until the money's in the bank
[17:38.000 --> 17:40.000]  And it isn't yet
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.000]  But I fully expect it to be, I have confidence
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.000]  I trust the people I'm working with
[17:46.000 --> 17:49.000]  So hopefully there'll be no hiccups there
[17:49.000 --> 17:53.000]  And so yeah, I'm just really pleased
[17:53.000 --> 17:57.000]  And I don't know how long this is going to go on for
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.000]  But in the meantime it buys me massive amounts of headroom
[18:01.000 --> 18:04.000]  Allows me to sort of relax a bit
[18:04.000 --> 18:12.000]  And to start to think a little bit more about what we might do from here
[18:12.000 --> 18:15.000]  I think I'm a little wild from coming to any conclusions on that
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  But watch this space
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  Anyway, finding myself back in front of my computer at my desk quite a lot
[18:23.000 --> 18:30.000]  I found it unsatisfactory having this environment around me all of the time
[18:30.000 --> 18:34.000]  Because I was used to sort of being able to do whatever I wanted
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  Go to my workshop or go out for walks and stuff
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  And you know, I like my job, I like doing what I do
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  But I don't really like being stuck in front of a screen all day
[18:45.000 --> 18:50.000]  But I thought at the very least I needed to sort of make this environment better
[18:50.000 --> 18:56.000]  Because it was really cluttered and cramped and sort of not very pleasant
[18:57.000 --> 19:02.000]  And so one of the things I needed was a laptop riser of some sort
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  To raise my laptop up
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  Firstly so that my camera is at the right height and my screen is at the right height
[19:08.000 --> 19:10.000]  So I don't get back problems
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.000]  And the other reason is because to achieve that goal
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.000]  I had a pile of books
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  And those books were taking up a lot of space on my desk
[19:22.000 --> 19:26.000]  It was quite hard for me to, you know, maneuver my mouse, for example
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  And I was like, what I need is one of these stands that has a sort of shelf on it
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  So that the laptop is, and the books are not taking up so much space
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  It's got an overhang
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  I jumped onto Amazon and started looking for these
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  Thinking, you know, I've got some money and then remembering that I don't really
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  And until that money comes in I can't spend it
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.000]  And also, you know, you look at these things on Amazon
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  It's just tat for a tenner these days
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  And it's probably fine
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  But, you know, looking at some of these contraptions
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  I was like, well, that doesn't really do what I want
[20:00.000 --> 20:02.000]  So let's have a look at another one
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.000]  It's okay, it doesn't really do what I want either
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  And then I was like, I just make one, right?
[20:08.000 --> 20:13.000]  And, you know, I'm surrounded by wood and woodworking stuff at the moment
[20:13.000 --> 20:17.000]  Because of my weird pivot into wood carving and so on
[20:17.000 --> 20:23.000]  I'm not actually very good at making real life things with wood
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  But I do it from time to time
[20:25.000 --> 20:29.000]  I've got enough confidence and enough materials and equipment
[20:29.000 --> 20:34.000]  To construct things that actually have some real world purpose
[20:34.000 --> 20:38.000]  And so I thought, why don't I make myself a laptop stand?
[20:38.000 --> 20:39.000]  And so I did it
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.000]  And it felt really good
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.000]  And I'm not the sort of person that's just going to sit around thinking about it
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.000]  And then go up and look up a YouTube video on how to do something like this
[20:51.000 --> 20:57.000]  And I just went out to my workshop and was like, here's some bits of wood
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  Right, what if I did this? I'll screw this onto here
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  I'll add this stand on here and I need a little hook there
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  And there's a little storage space over here
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  Oh, I need something to tidy my cables
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.000]  And I just started playing around and just kept on building
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  And I was like, oh my God, this has got to be stable enough
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  It can't tip over, so what do I have to do?
[21:15.000 --> 21:18.000]  And it was just so much fun
[21:18.000 --> 21:24.000]  And it was just an act of necessity, but an act of creativity
[21:24.000 --> 21:26.000]  And I'm really pleased with it
[21:26.000 --> 21:30.000]  It's on my desk now, it's a bit ramshackle
[21:30.000 --> 21:35.000]  I didn't bother trying to make it nicely, neatly cut
[21:35.000 --> 21:39.000]  Or painting it, you know, some beautiful color and sheen
[21:39.000 --> 21:43.000]  I just screwed bits of wood on here and there and you'll bit a metal
[21:43.000 --> 21:51.000]  And repurposed, like I've got a headphone holder on it
[21:51.000 --> 21:56.000]  Which is some old bit of metal that was for something similar
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  That I'd sort of cut up and repurposed
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.000]  And just used things around me that I had
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.000]  And I don't really care what it looks like, I just care that it's functional
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  But for me it's quite beautiful because I made it
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.000]  And it really does the job, and it's very very satisfying
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  That I get to exist with it on a day to day basis
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  And it's providing me value
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  And of course I got it on my desk and worked with it for a day or two
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  And I was like, oh this is not quite right
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  And I didn't do that bit properly and it needs a bit of this or bit of that
[22:29.000 --> 22:33.000]  And I just took it back out and I changed it
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  And I added to it and I made it better
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  And I will continue to do that
[22:39.000 --> 22:45.000]  And that's so much better than buying from some tap for a tenner
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  From Amazon or somewhere else
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  To get something that feels flimsy
[22:50.000 --> 22:55.000]  Or to spend buttloads of money on something that feels really classy
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  And then have it not be quite right
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  Or have to change the way that you're working to suit it
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  And therefore what are you going to do?
[23:04.000 --> 23:07.000]  You have to either just live with it or buy a new one
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  And that's how capitalism works, they want you to buy a new one
[23:10.000 --> 23:13.000]  Well I just don't want to live with that
[23:13.000 --> 23:18.000]  I got to fix this and it took me an hour or two
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  And it does exactly what I want
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.000]  I've made no compromises here
[23:23.000 --> 23:27.000]  And I think that the point I'm making here is that
[23:27.000 --> 23:33.000]  Yes of course I've got back to the old routine at least for a while
[23:33.000 --> 23:39.000]  But it hasn't really changed the sort of habits that I developed
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  While I wasn't working
[23:41.000 --> 23:47.000]  And the scarcity of the last 18 months in my life
[23:47.000 --> 23:54.000]  Has really pushed me into being much more creative and experimental and resourceful
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  Which is much more who I am at my core
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.000]  I was earning a good salary for quite a long time and I just got lazy
[24:02.000 --> 24:07.000]  And because if I wanted something more often than not
[24:07.000 --> 24:12.000]  I'm not buying Ferraris but if I wanted a new laptop stand I'd buy it
[24:12.000 --> 24:15.000]  And I could because I could afford it
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  And now I'm like well no
[24:17.000 --> 24:21.000]  Almost everything I think I need to get or buy
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  I second guess myself and think well is there another way I can achieve this
[24:26.000 --> 24:30.000]  And not only does it save me money
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  It really gives me pleasure
[24:32.000 --> 24:38.000]  And it really allows me to sort of flex my creative muscles and to learn something
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  And I consider that a gift
[24:40.000 --> 24:47.000]  This slightly ramshackle laptop stand made out of bits of old
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000]  I mean literally these are bits of wood that I discovered in a shed out the back
[24:52.000 --> 25:00.000]  I think that the main support for this is chopped up fence posts
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  I kid you not
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  And I didn't even treat them or anything I sanded them a bit
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  They've not been varnished or anything
[25:07.000 --> 25:15.000]  I don't care I might give this a paint job at some point as a little treat to myself
[25:15.000 --> 25:19.000]  But until I'm happy with it and I'm not going to change it anymore
[25:19.000 --> 25:23.000]  I'm not going to give it a paint job either because otherwise I'll just mess the paint job up
[25:23.000 --> 25:26.000]  A large part of my life changed
[25:26.000 --> 25:29.000]  It changed out of the blue
[25:29.000 --> 25:32.000]  And then that's precipitating more changes
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  But a sort of synthesis of what I've been living with
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  And where I'm moving to now
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  Which is a place that I'm much happier in
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  Than when I think back when I'd been working for a long period
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  As a sort of salaried employee
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  This feels really positive
[25:51.000 --> 25:54.000]  And it's also really, as I started off this
[25:54.000 --> 26:01.000]  Saying that looking for ways, creative ways to still do the things that I want to do
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  Well that's one of them, building a laptop stand
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  Another one is how do I keep making podcasts
[26:10.000 --> 26:13.000]  Now am I going to get Alex Bott to record everything for me
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  No and never, I mean that would be ridiculous
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  I actually like doing this
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  I just sort of got caught down a what if rabbit hole
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  Which I was having too much fun with
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.000]  So I just followed it through and I thought oh this will be fun to put on the episode
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  But the situation changing is
[26:30.000 --> 26:36.000]  Forcing me to look at things that I knew I needed to sort of figure out a while ago
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  In terms of making this stuff easier
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  And what can AI do to help if anything
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  The answer to that is a bit
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  It's much, much more helpful on the research side
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  But it can't write like I speak
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  And I don't want it to
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  I don't really use it at all for composition
[26:56.000 --> 27:02.000]  I only ever use it for research basically
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  So it's not taking over this job
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  But I like doing this
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  But how do I make it easier
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  Well there's all sorts of little bits and pieces
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.000]  And things I can do in automations
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  I'm a technologist so
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  Automating things is relatively easy
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  And it's something that AI is good for
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  Where you can say got all these files I need to moving here
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Changing in this way
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  Have a summary added to them and blah blah blah
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.000]  I'll basically organize my digital files
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  And it will just do it all for me
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  Specifically for those interested I use warp terminal
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  Which has a built in AI feature
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  So you can tell it in plain English what you want it to do
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.000]  And it just does it
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  It doesn't always do it properly
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  But it does ask you and tell you what it's doing
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  So if it's doing it horribly wrong
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  You can at least intervene
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  So I wouldn't recommend this for someone
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  Who wasn't already fairly well versed in
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  The Linux style command line interface
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  But for any of you that are
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  I can thoroughly recommend warp terminal
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  But yeah things like automation and stuff
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  And again you have to be quite creative here
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.000]  I really struggle with off the shelf products
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  That do almost anything
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  Be they in the real world or on computers
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  Because I've got very specific needs
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  I know what I want and I know generally how I want it done
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  And I don't generally want to have to change my whole world
[28:31.000 --> 28:34.000]  Or my whole approach to accommodate for a tool
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  That doesn't really quite do what I want
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  How I want to do it
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  Now sometimes you'll think out of something
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  That tries to force you to do that
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  And you realize no actually this is better
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  This is actually better than the way that I was going to do it
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  But more often than not I'm working the way that I want to work
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  Because that's how my brain works
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  And that's how I need to operate
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  And changing that is just going to be friction
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.000]  And probably quite a lot of heartache
[29:02.000 --> 29:07.000]  And so I tend, and this is why I learned to code and program in the first place
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  Is that I tend to want things done how I want them done
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  And so I have to be quite creative
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  And I have to come up with these solutions
[29:16.000 --> 29:22.000]  And I can get the internet or AI to help me solutionize a bit
[29:22.000 --> 29:25.000]  And to give me options and other ways to think about how to do it
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  But ultimately how am I going to get from A to B
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.000]  I'm going to get there the way that I want to get there
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  How do I make that easier
[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  How do I make it faster
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  How do I make it more efficient
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  And that's a really creative exercise
[29:39.000 --> 29:44.000]  And it's actually quite a lot of fun
[29:44.000 --> 29:47.000]  And I don't really see it as different at all
[29:47.000 --> 29:53.000]  From how do I take this image and turn it into a painting on canvas
[29:53.000 --> 29:57.000]  How do I take this bit of wood and turn it into something beautiful
[29:57.000 --> 30:03.000]  How do I take this pile of planks and fence posts
[30:03.000 --> 30:06.000]  And turn them into a laptop stand
[30:06.000 --> 30:13.000]  How do I automate the process of transcribing, summarizing and organizing
[30:13.000 --> 30:17.000]  My recorded podcast stuff and my voice notes
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  Because I make a lot of voice notes
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  Because I prefer to think while walking
[30:22.000 --> 30:23.000]  And so how do I deal with that
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.000]  And it's all the same thing
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  It's all just a creative continuum
[30:26.000 --> 30:29.000]  And I always look forward to doing this stuff
[30:29.000 --> 30:31.000]  And I always have
[30:31.000 --> 30:36.000]  One of the most formative moments of my younger life
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  Was when I first started
[30:39.000 --> 30:44.000]  One of my earliest jobs in computing and IT
[30:44.000 --> 30:45.000]  You may not know this
[30:45.000 --> 30:52.000]  But I was one of the first 15 or 20 employees in the UK by Amazon
[30:52.000 --> 31:02.000]  I actually worked for a small online book retail outlet called Book Pages
[31:02.000 --> 31:09.000]  Which was I think the first if not one of the first purely UK e-commerce sites there was
[31:09.000 --> 31:14.000]  And certainly I think we were the first book seller
[31:14.000 --> 31:19.000]  And so when Amazon expanded from the US
[31:19.000 --> 31:24.000]  The first territories they changed was UK and Germany
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  And in the UK rather than start from scratch they bought Book Pages
[31:28.000 --> 31:35.000]  And I'd been working there for a few quid an hour packing books
[31:35.000 --> 31:42.000]  Off a window seal in an office in Gerald's Cross in Buckinghamshire
[31:42.000 --> 31:44.000]  Just because I didn't know what else to do
[31:44.000 --> 31:47.000]  My mate was working there and he got me a job
[31:47.000 --> 31:52.000]  I was bought by Amazon at that point and I was in the dot com boom
[31:52.000 --> 31:58.000]  At the point I joined Book Pages I didn't know what an email was
[31:58.000 --> 32:07.000]  I'd never sent one and within a couple of years I was doing large scale infrastructure builds
[32:07.000 --> 32:16.000]  For warehouses and offices, IT infrastructure, cabling, support, operating systems, all this stuff
[32:16.000 --> 32:21.000]  It was crazy, it was absolutely bonkers
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.000]  This was before Amazon were evil
[32:24.000 --> 32:29.000]  And I actually did meet Jeff Bezos briefly for my sins
[32:29.000 --> 32:37.000]  Anyway, at one point I was working under a what you would call Unix or Linux admin
[32:37.000 --> 32:40.000]  Like a hardcore server techie
[32:40.000 --> 32:45.000]  And he taught me one of the most important lessons of my life
[32:45.000 --> 32:52.000]  Which was essentially what he characterized as the lazy school of Unix admin
[32:52.000 --> 32:57.000]  Which was if you don't want to do it automate it
[32:57.000 --> 33:01.000]  If you've got to do it, say more than twice, automate it
[33:01.000 --> 33:04.000]  Just build a script
[33:04.000 --> 33:08.000]  In those days it was Perl but in those days it might be Python or something
[33:08.000 --> 33:11.000]  And you just make it go away
[33:11.000 --> 33:14.000]  You write a script that will do that thing and then you schedule it
[33:14.000 --> 33:16.000]  And then you go and do something else
[33:16.000 --> 33:18.000]  And I was like well what else are you going to do
[33:18.000 --> 33:19.000]  He goes well whatever you want
[33:19.000 --> 33:21.000]  I was like well what?
[33:21.000 --> 33:24.000]  I don't know, just go down to pub or something, whatever
[33:24.000 --> 33:26.000]  And I was like really?
[33:26.000 --> 33:31.000]  Well no, you might do but what you're probably going to do is go and find something else more interesting to do
[33:31.000 --> 33:37.000]  And it's basically like well what my job is is to do myself out of a job
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.000]  But then I was like well then you'll be out of a job
[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  And he goes no I won't because I'll go and find more important things to do
[33:43.000 --> 33:48.000]  And he really didn't care what his team did as long as the job got done
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  And so one of his people Rob would just sit there day trading
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  He would just sit there with a stock ticker in the corner of his screen
[33:57.000 --> 34:02.000]  And automating stuff away so he could spend more time making money on the side
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  And it was just okay
[34:04.000 --> 34:09.000]  And I'm not the sort of person that will use automation to slack off
[34:09.000 --> 34:14.000]  And to be fair if you're the sort of person that thinks that way
[34:14.000 --> 34:17.000]  Then you're not going to slack off
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  You're going to automate something and then move on to the next most interesting thing
[34:21.000 --> 34:22.000]  And you do that a few times
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  You start to find a bit tiresome so you automate that
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  And you keep going
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  And this is a credo I've basically lived my life by ever since
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  Is that don't do it twice which really suits my ADHD brain
[34:33.000 --> 34:39.000]  And learn to really love the process of making problems go away
[34:39.000 --> 34:43.000]  And it's seen me into some really interesting places
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  And it's allowed me to really excel in lots of areas
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  And a lot of people just can't fathom it
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.000]  It's like you've got to do a job
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  Or you've been paid to do that job so do it
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  Why though?
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  Why if I can make that job go away would I do it?
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  And I think that if more people understood that
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  The world would be a better place
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.000]  But I think some people just seem to do what they're told
[35:10.000 --> 35:11.000]  And I'm not very good at that
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  But we've been over that ground before
[35:14.000 --> 35:19.000]  Anyway, this is me digressing very, very large amounts
[35:19.000 --> 35:20.000]  But it all does fit together
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  This is all part of my life and my personality
[35:23.000 --> 35:29.000]  The sort of lesson here is that you've got to hold on to hope
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  Because things will change
[35:31.000 --> 35:37.000]  Something will happen that will give you a little chink of opportunity
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  To drive a wedge into and make into something bigger
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  So I'm already thinking about how I capitalise on this new contract
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.000]  And what I can do to keep it running or to use it to springboard me into other
[35:52.000 --> 35:56.000]  Work with a whole bunch more confidence
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  And that change came out of nowhere
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  I didn't even see it
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  It just turned up in my inbox
[36:01.000 --> 36:07.000]  And so it's been a really interesting few weeks of discovery
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  And I'm not out of the woods yet
[36:09.000 --> 36:12.000]  But it's a massive step in the right direction
[36:12.000 --> 36:18.000]  I've got a lovely new ramshackle laptop stand
[36:18.000 --> 36:22.000]  And a mini me, a mini AI me
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  And no doubt lots of other things
[36:26.000 --> 36:31.000]  And I still spend every evening in my workshop
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  Making a mess and having fun with bits of wooden canvas and so on
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  And I will continue to do that
[36:39.000 --> 36:44.000]  Because that's the thing that I need to keep me healthy and sane
[36:44.000 --> 36:48.000]  And it's the thing that got me through this really dark period
[36:48.000 --> 36:52.000]  And so I think maybe the message here is
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  Creativity is always important and it's always useful
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  And you can either use it purely on its own to make you feel better
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.000]  Or you can use it to change things about your life
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  While doing them make you feel better
[37:09.000 --> 37:14.000]  While making those changes, while creating your laptop stand
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  You feel good about it
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  And you're also helping other parts of your life as well
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  And I don't know, I feel a little bit mixed up with the message here
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  But this is what these episodes are for
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  For me to stand in front of a microphone
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  And sort of ramble about what's going on in my brain
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  And I think there's lots going on in my brain
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.000]  There's so many things swirling around
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  And so many different ways of thinking about the change that's occurred
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  And what it means and where I go from here
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  That's probably coming out in the way that I'm talking
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  But I don't consider this a bad thing
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  Anyway, I just glanced up at my clock
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  And guess what, it's time to start work
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.000]  How exciting
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.000]  It really is, I'm recording this before 9 o'clock, it's about 10 to 9
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.000]  And I will start work at 9
[38:11.000 --> 38:19.000]  And I haven't even got changed out of my morning lounging clothes yet
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  Not that it matters since my job is working from home
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  But sitting in front on a call, should one arise in the dressing gown
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  Is not generally the best look
[38:29.000 --> 38:35.000]  So I'm going to go and get changed and get back onto my day job
[38:35.000 --> 38:41.000]  And I fully intend to keep this up weekly if I can
[38:41.000 --> 38:45.000]  You'll forgive me if the frequency is either a little bit erratic
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  Or sometimes I have to skip a week
[38:48.000 --> 38:53.000]  But I fully intend not to, I just can't absolutely be sure that I can
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  And hopefully I can keep the quality up
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  Because this really is important to me
[39:00.000 --> 39:06.000]  And I hope that hearing about my experiences helps you a bit
[39:06.000 --> 39:09.000]  And if you're having a hard time at the moment
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  Then just know that things get better
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.000]  Things change, opportunities arise
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  They don't always come from where you think they're going to come from
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  But they will come and things will get better
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.000]  And I hope that gives you some comfort
[39:24.000 --> 39:29.000]  And I'm going to go and get ready for work
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  Bye
[39:54.000 --> 40:01.000]  I'm going to go and get ready for work
