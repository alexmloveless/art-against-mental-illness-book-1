## Barriers to Starting (Lines 61-108)
### Time and Distraction (Lines 61-63)
- "I just don't have the time"

- Life getting in the way

### Trauma Response (Lines 63-71)
- Past negative experiences with creativity
- Lack of support or excessive criticism
- School teachers, friends, siblings being brutal
- Fear of being made to feel small or minimized

### Low Confidence (Lines 71-76)
- "I can't do this, I suck"
- "I've never been good with art"
- "I'm not very creative"
- Self-limiting beliefs about abilities

### Perfectionism (Lines 76-87)
- Mistaken for sensible thinking
- "Can't start/continue, it's not good enough"
- Need for respect, pride, showing others
- False starts and putting work out there

### Imposter Syndrome (Lines 87-88)
- Feeling surrounded by people who "really know what they're doing"
- Feeling like complete imposter

### Creative Block/Analysis Paralysis (Lines 88-95)
- Writer's block and equivalents
- Overthinking preventing movement
- Can't conjure new ideas or enthusiasm
- Existing creators unable to start again

### Modern Life Distractions (Lines 96-108)
- Phone constantly chirping
- Doom scrolling on Facebook
- Dopamine hunting on Instagram/TikTok
- Getting sucked into YouTube videos
- Time disappearing, leading to self-recrimination cycle

## Alex's Personal Creative Process (Lines 116-189)
### Spontaneous Approach (Lines 120-133)
- Doesn't plan much, naturally spontaneous
- ADHD-influenced: gets bored quickly
- Sketches and studies lead to boredom by third attempt
- Acts on ideas as soon as they come

### Practical Implementation (Lines 133-140)
- Scribble down ideas when can't act immediately
- Keep notebook or to-do list
- "I then just get on with it"

### Multiple Projects Strategy (Lines 140-168)
- Always has multiple things going simultaneously
- Set up studio/life/approach for reactive creativity
- Commissions take precedence but parallelize with other work
- Switches between projects when bored or stuck
- Takes breaks from pieces (day to years)
- Revisits old work with fresh perspective

### Benefits of This Approach (Lines 168-176)
- Makes starting easier
- Relaxed rules on perfectionism
- Doesn't worry about finishing or looking perfect
- All part of wider process
- Constant enthusiasm for new starts

## Current Creative State Example (Lines 177-189)
- Just finished major commission
- Immediately started making new canvases
- Playing around with old ideas
- Not judging early results
- Looking forward to returning to pieces later

## Practical Advice for Starting (Lines 189-211)
### Just Do Something (Lines 189-201)
- Break the barrier by doing anything
- Take paper and start scribbling
- Start up PC and record yourself talking
- Type words into document
- Don't be judgmental about beginnings
- Don't critique quick sketches
- Move on to next if not satisfied

### Embrace the Creative Process (Lines 201-211)
- Constantly making choices and little criticisms
- Criticism is part of the process
- Can't let it bog you down
- Let it flow
- Transform blank canvas into something beautiful through decisions

## Flow States and Mental Health (Lines 211-251)
### Flow State Importance (Lines 211-219)
- Beginnings trigger flow states
- Mode of concentration where world falls away
- Sucked into task/activity
- Profound effect on movement through creative process
- Keeps process continuous

### Mental Health Connection (Lines 220-236)
- Flow states break cycles of ruminant destructive thinking
- Immediate effect of art on mental health
- More immediate than CBT for Alex
- Breaks anxiety cycles and destructive thought patterns

### Personal Mental Health Management (Lines 236-251)
- Mental health very variable throughout life
- Art hasn't cured anxiety but helps manage it
- Built creative opportunities into daily routine
- At least one hour daily in studio
- Free from people, constraints, responsibilities
- Allows world to fall away and relaxation
- Gets rid of anxious ruminant thoughts

## Addressing the "Whole Self" Misconception (Lines 252-304)
### The Dangerous Misconception (Lines 252-269)
- Biggest contributor to procrastination
- Idea that you must bring your whole self
- That self must spew onto page/canvas
- That it must mean something
- This thinking is "dangerous"

### Reality of Creative Process (Lines 269-304)
- Self leaks out naturally in everything you do
- Don't have to think about that process
- Multitasking is normal and healthy
- Examples: writing while watching TV, drawing while listening to podcasts
- Never doing one thing at a time
- Never bringing whole self to any task
- TV/Netflix while doing creative work
- Drawing while watching TV as relaxation
- Process itself is the therapy
- Process can pervade every part of life

## Homework Assignment (Lines 308-325)
### Simple Creative Exercise
- Pick up pad and drawing implement, start scribbling
- Open notepad/word and start writing whatever's in brain
- Dust off old guitar and strum (don't even tune it)
- Same with piano/keyboard - make noise
- Do whatever for 10 minutes
- Focus on experience, not finished piece
- Reflect on how it makes you feel
- Don't record the noise - focus on the experience

## Closing and Contact Information (Lines 325-329)
- Promise to discuss process more next time
