## Secondary Themes

### 6. The "Whole Self" Misconception
**Core Message**: The dangerous belief that you must bring your whole self to creative work and that it must mean something profound.

**Why It's Problematic**:

- Multitasking is normal and healthy
- Creative work can be casual and integrated into daily life

### 7. Spontaneous vs. Planned Creativity
**Core Message**: Spontaneous, reactive creativity can be more effective than heavily planned approaches.

**Alex's Approach**:
- ADHD-influenced spontaneous process
- Gets bored with extensive planning and studies
- Acts on ideas immediately when possible
- Multiple projects allow for natural flow between ideas
- Breaks traditional "finish one thing before starting another" mentality

### 8. Non-Linear Creative Process
**Core Message**: Creative work doesn't have to follow traditional linear progression models.

**Key Elements**:
- Working on pieces for years without completion pressure
- Returning to old work with fresh perspective
- Multiple simultaneous projects
- Natural switching between pieces when bored or stuck
- Breaks and holidays from projects are valuable

### 9. Practical Mental Health Management
**Core Message**: Art provides practical tools for ongoing mental health management rather than one-time solutions.

**Key Elements**:

- Breaks initial barriers that prevent all other benefits
- Simple 10-minute exercises can demonstrate value
- Focus on beginning rather than completing
