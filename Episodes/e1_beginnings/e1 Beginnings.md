Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast.
My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast about the healing powers of art
for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an interest in mental
health and well-being. Welcome to my podcast. I'm recording from
my garden studio so you might hear some birds around me.
Hopefully this is first of many episodes of my podcast.
We're going to talk about beginnings today. I love starting things,
for example podcasts. I'm not so good at finishing but I don't really
intend to finish this. Hopefully this is an ongoing thing.
So the best stories rarely start at the beginning.
They tend to jump into the middle and work their way outwards from there.
I don't really see this as a linear narrative. I see this as a
sort of more set of interlinked themes and stories and subject
that you can come in at any point and find something that you can relate to.
I'm also not going to do a long introduction about why I believe artist
therapy and why I'm doing this podcast at all.
I think that will come out in the mix. We'll talk in the future about my own
struggles with mental illness as well as my journey to discovering
art of the therapeutic outlet. But this podcast isn't therapy. Well okay
it is a bit in part for me but this needs to be useful
to other people and not just me and it needs to be practical.
Others need to experience the therapeutic value of art.
So we'll hear some stories hopefully from me and from some other people
but we'll also be talking about some stuff that you can do to help to
maintain your own mental health and help those around you maintain theirs.
So I'm a creator most prominently of artworks, paintings,
drawings that type of thing and it also seems now podcasts and various other
things too. But I think that all artist therapy
regardless of your relationship to it and so I'll be exploring all aspects of
art even the bits I'm not myself particularly familiar with.
This episode is still about beginnings, beginning your art journey or just
beginning your next piece or even just getting back into it.
Perhaps oddly I'm going to start talking about not starting
or specifically the barriers to starting. The opposite
of starting things is procrastination and this is something you'll hear spoken
about a lot both in the art community, in the mental
health community, the neurodiversity community
and there's quite a few reasons why you might not be able to start something.
I just don't have the time, I keep trying and then I get
distracted, my life just keeps getting in the way.
Procrastination is also to some degree a trauma response.
I think a lot of people have tried to start creative projects in the past and
perhaps have been let down by those around them who
haven't been supportive or have been overly critical.
Perhaps it was a teacher at school, perhaps it was
a girlfriend or a friend or a sibling, particularly siblings can be quite
brutal in your early expeditions as a creative or creator or an artist
and so you don't want to repeat that, you don't want to risk being
made to feel small or minimized and that leads into the sort of next thing which
which is that's a form of of low confidence
and I can't do this, I suck, I've never been good with art, I'm not very
creative, I can't write, I can't sing, I can't dance and
and of course at this point maybe you can't,
maybe you can or maybe you can do some of it and that again leads on to the
next point which is perfectionism and and this is a killer I think that
people mistake for sensible thinking but
really isn't that you know I can't start this,
I can't carry on with this piece of work, it's not good enough,
I need for for this to be good enough so that people
respect me so that I can be proud of this so that I can show it to people
and so maybe you've had a few false starts in the past and
and you've kind of put yourself out there, you've put your art, you put your
creations out there and and you sort of really feel like
you're surrounded by people who really know what they're doing, that they're
really really on it and that you feel like a complete imposter and we get into
imposter syndrome. Another reason is creative block,
perhaps analysis paralysis, we've heard it a lot
called writer's block and that's where you know you're already out there
creating but you simply can't seem to start again, you can't seem to
move on to the next chapter, the next painting, the next drawing,
you can't seem to move, you you just over you're overthinking or
you can't conjure up any new ideas or any enthusiasm
and and so that's one of the very big big problems I think
existing creatives have. And then there's just the general noise of modern
life, your phone is constantly chirping away at
you, drawing your attention, you end up doom
scrolling on Facebook, dopamine hunting on
Instagram or TikTok or getting sucked into
YouTube videos and suddenly the two hours you had spare
have disappeared and that was the time that you should have been
perhaps being creative and you end up in a bit of a cycle there of
self-recrimination, well I didn't do that, I didn't do the thing that I should
have been doing, I wasn't creative, I didn't set out to do something
positive or I'm a terrible person, well this is just me I have to live with
that. And I think that all these things can
come into play at some point in terms of
stopping you from starting. We'll delve down on all of these perhaps some of
them in great detail in the future and I could sit here for a really long time
now going through each of those and explaining
why these things happen in detail and how to overcome them and why they are
often false methods of thinking and we'll come to
that in the future but I wanted this first episode to feel
positive and practical and so I want to talk about
just how to how to just get started. So I'm going to talk about how I get
started and I'm also going to cover off a few
of the misconceptions about getting started and
getting on your way for your creative project or endeavor.
So I don't I don't plan a lot, I don't think a lot about the
artworks that I produce. My process is is naturally spontaneous,
I think this comes from the ADHD half of my brain.
I get bored with projects really quickly so if I
like some artists do create lots of sketches,
lots of studies to build up to a final piece that then you finally can get stuck
into and start working on. By the time I've got through my third
sort of sketch and study I'm bored with the idea, I've talked
myself out of it or I've just got distracted by a shiny
new thing, a new idea and that all gets forgotten about and
I've had so many false starts by trying too
trying too hard to start, trying too hard to make something
and some outcome that that I had in my head at that moment in time
and I actually find it best to just to act on my ideas
as soon as they come into my head. It's not always possible you know if you're
out out for a walk in the middle of the countryside in the middle of a city or
you're in a meeting at work, you can't do that so the best thing to
do is just to scribble down have something next
to you and scribble down your idea and and try and remember it to come back to
it later or just create a notebook or a to-do list somewhere of
stuff that you've thought. I then just get on with it, the reason I
can do this and actually ever finish anything is
because I always have multiple things on the go at the same time.
I've set my studio, my life, my approach up so I can
react to ideas as they come to me and I can set priorities and
so I might have a commission on of course that takes precedence especially
if I've got a time limit on it but I can always
parallelize that with other stuff that allow my creative juices to keep
flowing in different directions and so I'll have lots of things on at
the same time and but I'll get to a point where I'll go
I've been working on this for a bit. I'm a bit bored but I'm not very happy. I
don't really like it as it is but there's probably something here or even
if there isn't I'll just stop and I will put that aside and I will go
back to one of the other pieces I was working on or I will start a new piece
and I always used to think that this was a terrible thing because I'll never go
back to these. I don't tend to like repeating myself but
actually what I found is that if I give myself a little break a holiday and that
can be anything from a day to a year or two to several
years in some cases I've got pieces of artwork that I've
been working on on and off for literally four years and I'm
fine with that because I've always got new things
churning through so I do revisit them. I do go back to them and I
do often you know make take them and I'll over finish
the the idea that I was on or I will take it in a new direction and that's a
new start it's a new beginning. Well here's a piece
I look at it now and I think of it about it totally differently
and so I start taking that in a new direction which for me is a new piece of
art it's a new idea and I love surfing on that new stuff
enthusiasm. So I will always be trying to start things
and so it makes me quite good at starting
and because I've relaxed my rules on on things like perfectionism because I
don't worry too much about things being or
having to be finished or looking perfect I
don't mind starting new things and and going on to other things
because it's all part of the process it all forms part of a wider process
and that's really important to me because it means I don't find it hard to
start. Now it's worth bearing in mind that I am
I'm in a bit of a fugue state at the moment I've
just finished a really big commission that was really amazing and creative and
some of the best work I've ever done and I've sort of stopped and so much of
my creative energy and my time went into that
that I'm now stopped and I'm trying to think what to do next
but I didn't stop I didn't. I immediately started making new canvases
I immediately started playing around and just making a mess
and and I took some old ideas that I had and I just started playing around with
them and shoving them on canvases and they're not very good and I'm
looking at one now thinking that's actually okay it's fine
and and maybe I'll pick it up later today or maybe I'm just going to stick
it aside but that's just fine and I almost look forward to that moment
when I get back to it then that's how you get started and I
think just breaking that barrier and just doing something
anything just take a piece of paper out and start scribbling on it
start up your PC record yourself talking about something
start tapping some words into a into a document
just do anything to just do something don't be judgmental about it don't be
judgmental about beginnings don't look at a sketch you just did and think
well that took me about 10 minutes and it's rubbish and it wasn't worth doing
just move on to the next one if you look back at it and you think well this isn't
okay I don't think this is very good then
fine right put it aside start something new and
that's what's really important to be doing things and to be
not to be critical about the things that you're doing
while you're doing them you're constantly making choices you're
constantly making doing little criticisms as you go along
when you're making a work of art and that's that's how it works that's how
the creative process works that's what how when you start at one point
and you finish it another you end up with something that when it started was
just nothing was a blank canvas and at the end is something beautiful
because you took lots of little creative and critical decisions as you go along
and criticism in part of the process and you can't let it bog you down
you have to just let it flow that's why beginnings are so important that's why
starting something is important because you're looking for that flow
and we'll go into flow states later on probably
in quite some depth but if you can trigger one of these
flow states when you get into that mode of concentration where the world falls
away and you're sucked into that task you're
sucked into that activity then that's where you want to be and
that's going to have such a profound effect
in terms of keeping you moving and taking you on to the next idea
and moving you through that creative process so it never stops
and this is really what this is all about because when we talk about mental
health as relates to art when we talk about
art as a therapeutic practice it's really these flow states there's a
there's a lot of a lot more going on here in terms of the interaction with
art and the outside world communication with people the sense of
self and the sense of fulfillment you get from it
but one of the most important and immediate effects you get from art
is those flow states that break these cycles of ruminant
destructive thinking that personify so many people's poor mental health or
mental illness and anxiety is a response to
something that's happened perhaps in the outside world but how you're reacting to
it in your own head and this is where you get things like
cognitive behavioral therapy CBT which looks to break those cycles of
of destructive thoughts and some people find
that type of therapy really really valuable and
and it was less so for me it powers into comparison
to me being able to get into these artistic flow states
now my mental health is very variable and has been for my whole life
and i think that being creative and having art as a creative outlet
hasn't cured my problems of anxiety i will never cure those
so i need to manage my mental health permanently
and so i've built the opportunities to create these flow states to create these
creative interludes into my life into my challenge into my schedule into my daily
routine and so i have at least an hour every
day in my studio free from other people free from
constraints free from anything that i'm supposed to be
doing responsibilities chores anything like that i come into my studio
and i do whatever i want and that for me is where i
i can let the world fall away and just relax
and get rid of some of those anxious ruminant thoughts those persistent
ideas or or that urge to be doing something or
being productive in some other way and i can relax and i really really do relax
and i want to just zone in on one particular sort of misconception here
because i do talk about being in my studio and being sort of
monotropically focused myopically focused on
the creative process but that suggests that i'm bringing my whole
self to that creative process at that moment
that i'm focused on the process i'm focused on the creative act and
i think this is one of the biggest and most pernicious and dangerous misconceptions
that stops people from starting on any creative journey is this idea
that you have to bring your whole self that you have to bring your whole self
and then that has to spew out onto the page or the canvas and
that it has to mean something and i think this is so dangerous i
think this is such a dangerous way of thinking
and it's it's probably one of the biggest contributors to procrastination
you don't have to bring your whole self this is not what this is about
yourself is going to leak out everywhere in everything you do
whether you want to or not right you don't have to think about that process
it happens naturally the moment you start creating and and
so you don't have to just say well i have to be
here focused and doing just this one thing i
write blog posts while watching the television i
draw and paint while listening to podcasts
i conceive of ideas while out walking i constantly am churning things in my head
i'm never doing one thing at a time and i never bring my whole self to any given
task i simply can't sit and watch the tv i'm not
capable but i still love the things that i can watch on the tv i still put love
putting netflix on and and catching up with my
latest you know whatever i'm currently binge watching but i'm
never doing just that i'm always doing something creative on
the side and and i try and do things that don't
distract me from what i'm trying to watch on the tv but
most people these days anyway are sitting there with their phone
in one hand doom scrolling through their social media feed
and and only half paying attention to what's on the tv
to the point where tv makers now acknowledge this
and the scripts and formats and tv formats are created
so that you can experience them without paying
whole attention to that you can have all sorts of opinions about why that is but
for someone like me that's a godsend and it means i can do something like
drawing which doesn't take me out of what's happening on
on the drama that's on the tv but allows me to do something with my hands
allows me to relax more into something and to practice my
creative skills and to to make something beautiful and i
do a lot of drawing while watching tv and and i don't do much with those
drawings and the drawings aren't the point there it's a relaxation
it's it's the process i'm going through and it's the ability to engage my brain
in something that takes me away from from the world
around me and and it's really important i'm going to come back to this theme a
hell of a lot that i thoroughly believe in art as a
medium of connection and communication but that's only part of what's going on
and that you need to also remember that the process itself is just as important
as all the individual pieces of selling or showing or getting feedback
the whole process is the therapy the whole process is the whole thing
and that that can pervade every part of your life and i'm going to go into this
in a lot more detail in the next episode where we talk about process in in a bit
more detail and why it's so important and valuable
so i'm going to start rabbiting on now i'm going to start setting a bit of
homework and we'll keep this quite easy to begin with i want you to
just go off and do something right i want you to start i want you to pick up
a pad and and any writing drawing implement and
just start scribbling i want you to open up a notepad or
word or something on your computer and just start writing it doesn't matter
what whatever's in your brain at that moment in time i want you to
go and dust off that old guitar you've got in the corner of your
spare room and just start strumming away
right don't even bother tuning it just make some noise
same if you've got a piano or a keyboard and the old cassio keyboard
in your cupboard dust it off go and make a bit of noise
do whatever it is just do something and do it for 10 minutes
all i'm asking is for 10 minutes 10 minutes
of whatever it is that you think might help you stimulate some creative juices
and and then see how that makes you feel and reflect on not the finished
piece not anything that actually happens don't
record the noise that you made just look back and focus on the experience
and that's what i want you to do see how that makes you feel and we'll talk
about that process more next time so that's all for now and i'll see you
next time if you want to find out more about me i
