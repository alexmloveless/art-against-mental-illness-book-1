**Transcript:**

welcome to the art against mental illness podcast my name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast about the healing powers of art for artists art lovers the art curious and anyone with an interest in mental health and well-being calmness of Mind does not mean you should stop your activity real calmness should be found in the activity itself we say it is easy to have calmness in in activity it is hard to have calmness in activity but calmness in activity is true calmness Shan Rio Suzuki Zen mind beginner's mind real wisdom is the ability to understand the incredible extent to which you yourself every single moment of every single day Brad Warner sit down and shut up punk rock commentaries on Buddha God truth sex death and dogen's treasury of the right Dharma eye Zen Buddhist set a lot of stock in sitting still the word zen itself derives from the Chinese word chan and basically means meditation Zen referred to meditation as zazen which translates to sitting Zen or sitting meditation to them the act of sitting and shutting up is a very Act of engaging with the universe of interfacing with infinity communing with God when you practice zazen you're one with all beings in fact you are all beings meditation in the Zen sense means hitting the pause button on your body and mind taking some time to Free Your Mind of the thoughts that bind us to reality with all its prickly sticky messiness when you meditate properly you are not thinking no thoughts you are simply not thinking you are just being but you don't have to sit still to achieve this according to Zen you're in Z Zen at all times you are always at one with the universe it's just that when you're out and about in the big wide world drinking coffee and tapping manically at your phone giving someone a sick burn on the socials you're unable to recognize this you're too busy with Petty distractions only when you sit down shut up and clear your mind for a few minutes can you EXP experience true reality but reality exists in the background while you exist in your state of Perpetual delusion you just have to stop ruminating on that weird comment your friend made yesterday and notice what's going on right now this is often referred to as mindfulness and it's a word that's been so used and abused over the years it's become almost meaningless but it does have meaning it means you're a present ideally in the purest sense this is something you should practice as much as possible you should commune with the universe wherever possible as we shall see it's good for the body and mind but for those of us who suffer chronic mental illness its value and purpose is much more practical and arguably more essential to understand why this is we need to rewind a bit to the Glorious Neuroscience of the prior episode in this series so if you listen to part one of this series you might remember that I talked about homeostasis if you don't remember this then that may mean that you didn't listen to part one therefore you should probably go and do that since otherwise this episode probably won't make much sense so homeostasis is the concept of a system being in equilibrium the system in this case being your nervous system and by extension your body the whole of you I've talked about the fact that when you are suffering from mental illness such as chronic anxiety and depression your nervous system has got stuck in a panic state that I refer to as bad homeostasis perhaps I may to sound like this means you're in a state where your body cannot achieve equilibrium but this is not the case you're in equilibrium just an undesirable one you see your nervous system doesn't really have a preferred state it just cares that its state is appropriate for the environment it takes its cue from what your senses perceive about the environment and what those signals mean and what they might mean for your future State the brain is essentially a prediction machine and this is a concept that I'm going to return to a lot in the future your mind has a model of the world that's perceived by you and makes predictions about future States usually the most imminent future States essentially it makes some assumptions BAS based on past experience about what might happen next so if you walk into your bedroom your brain's model has this room containing a bed before you enter If instead of a bed there is a large pile of Lego bricks where your bed should be then you'll experience surprise which is what happens when events in reality don't match the range of events our brains consider possible if instead you walk into your bedroom and see your bed merely strewn with Lego pieces you will still be surprised but much less so since in this scenario you have kids who have Lego and a habit of playing playing with said Lego in places you'd rather they didn't conversely if you walked into that room and were presented with vast vistas of sand dunes and giant sandworms battling spacecraft then you'd be very surprised indeed unless that is you have a giant screen in your bedroom and someone is in there watching June your nervous system sets its equilibrium to whatever state suits your environment if you live in a war zone your nervous system is likely to be permanently in fight or flight mode since you could encounter guns and bombs and any number of rather nasty things at any moment if you're sitting on your sofa binge watching episodes of the D of painting with Bob Ross with his soothing tones and strangely alluring afro then your nervous system will be in rest and digest mode all of this is exactly as it should be being stuck in fight off FL mode is likely an optimal response to being in a war zone since being ready to flee is arguably the optimal state for such situations yes being constantly stressed is bad but being captured maimed or dead are all arguably worse the problem arises when the inverse happens attempting to loaf on your sofa you find that Bob ross' soothing tones do nothing to calm your brain because your brain is not thinking about old paintings it's obsessing about that snarky email you were sent yesterday your fidgety biting your nails looking through the TV and have a knot in your stomach you're in fight or flight mode and now come to think of it you've been that way for a while now when was the last time you actually able to sit in front of the TV and relax your nervous system has found an an equilibrium that is inappropriate for your surroundings this problem arises because all reactions to all situations happen in your head you don't have to be afraid of the tiger salivating in your general direction but it's helpful to be so your nervous system has a deep seated understanding that this is bad even when the tiger is at the other side of some sturdy bars not being afraid is the bad thing but maybe you're a tiger Tamer and you're not afraid that confidence may or may not be founded in reality but one way or the other you're not stressed in a situation where perhaps you should be it's all in your head you see your nervous system responds to how you perceive the environment which is not always a realistic or even vaguely appropriate perception therefore while you sit obsessing about that job interview that's 4 days away your nervous system earnestly responds to your trepidation by triggering fight or flight not in 5 days time but now while Bob is putting some detailing on that tree it doesn't care that there's no tiger the fear is real because you think it's real Therefore your nervous system responds accordingly increasing your levels of adrenaline noradrenaline and cortisol and you feel wired and worried Bob Ross Fades into the background while you sit and fret and doom scroll to take your mind off it as I said in the last episode anxiety begets anxiety and once your body gets in that state if you don't remove the perceived threat in this case the ruminations then it will stay in stress mode and likely find some more stuff to worry about so unless you're in the wars zone or confronted with the giant salivating feline then the solution to your problem resides in your head in short you've got to stop thinking the bad thoughts easy right well if it were you wouldn't be staring at the ceiling at 5:00 a.m. thinking them would you but this is where the mindfulness comes back into play and by extension you guessed it art let me paint another picture for you a forest or bushire is burning its way to a town increasing in intensity as it finds more fuel and creating desol in its wake frantic fire Crews turn up and some of them go to dump water at the advancing front another group heads a few miles towards the town here they start clearing the trees and foliage in a line parallel to the advancing fire they might even use fire to do this why well you're probably aware that this is a fire break they create a strip of land free of flammable material wide enough so that no flames can cross it so that when the fire reaches it it cannot advance and hopefully pet is out maybe the fire makes it across but you slow it down for a while calm it down a bit by starving it of fuel and it gives the firefighters a chance to make another fire break which will slow it down further if you do this enough you're hopefully able to stop the fire entirely the Flames are your anxious thoughts and the fire break is some activity that creates a gap in the path of these thoughts which stops them dead in their tracks doing so once will help a little but doing so regularly could stop the surge entirely to extend the analogy medicine such as anti-depressants which we spoke about in the last episode are like the fire Crews with the water hoses on the front line of the blaze they hold anxiety at Bay so you can do what's needed in this case create some more fire breaks and what are some good ways to create those fire breaks meditation mindfulness and creativity I can hear you breathe an audible side of relief as I finally get to the point a full explanation of what mindfulness is and how to achieve it is outside the scope of this particular discussion but here's a quick recap according to Wikipedia mindfulness is the cognitive skill usually developed through meditation of sustaining meta tentative awareness towards the contents of one's own mind in the present moment well that's pretty clear right put more simply but perhaps less succinctly mindfulness is the state of being mentally present in the now this involves progressively disassociating your mind's processes from the thoughts within this sounds a bit contradictory since it seems to most of us that our minds and our thoughts are the same thing but most of what happens in our brains and body happens without us noticing for example you fled from the tiger before you even had time to consider your predicament thoughts are just one facet of human cognition therefore it's not so bizarre to consider relegating these thoughts to the cheap seats and watching the real game unencumbered the best known approach for achieving this is via meditation which usually involve sitting still and focusing on something specific commonly your breath or perhaps a meaningless phrase sometimes called a mantra but there are other ways to achieve this for example using apps like headspace having another person guide you through it and yoga mindfulness has its roots in Buddhist and Hindu Traditions but there's a whole industry that's sprung up around it now that's saturated with chances and charlatans to the point where psychologist Thomas Joiner is quoted suggesting that mindfulness meditation has been corrupted for commercial gain by self-help celebrities and suggested it encourages unhealthy narcissistic and self-obsessed mindsets while American clinical psychologist Jeremy saffron dubbed it Muk mindfulness however the effectiveness of mindfulness has a long history of research some more robust than others but the general consensus seems to be that it is an effective means of managing a large spectrum of psychological conditions neurological Studies have indicated that over time it can actually change the structure of the brain suggesting that gray matter concentrations in the brain region that regulate emotion self-referential processing learning and memory processes have shown Chang in density some studies suggest that the regular practice of mindfulness focused activities increases mindfulness in general meaning that you're more mindful when participating in any other activity and it's been found to be very effective in the treatment of ruminant thoughts and consistent anxiety not only does it provide the fire break effect that I've described but the overall effect can make it easier to combat these types of thoughts at any other time once you cut off those unhelpful thoughts you starve them of fuel your nervous system can start D ing back its Panic response less of the fight ORF flight neurochemicals are released such as adrenaline and cortisol and more of the rest and digest neurochemicals such as serotonin and gabber are released you might slip back into your anxious State soon after the mindful activity but as you regularly repeat it like our repeated fire breakes you start to find those thoughts lowering in volume and frequency this is the process of your nervous system finding a more appropriate equilibrium since it was the unhelpful thoughts that were causing you to be stuck in fight or flight mode discontinuing them allows you to exit that state your nervous system finds a new equilibrium in a calmer State good homeostasis I've practiced meditation on and off for a couple of decades now and I've certainly felt the benefits in terms of recognizing unhelpful thoughts and sewing them away but with a family work chores social life and all the other fun stuff we pass our time with finding time space and peace to meditate can be Troublesome if you can combine mindfulness with other activities that help help you create a state of focus and calm then mindful states can often be easier to achieve when I started making art again more seriously around 7 years ago I found even less time for mindfulness however once I'd found my groove in the creative realm I started to notice that I was achieving states of focus when in front of my easel that resembled meditation and it left me feeling similarly relaxed and balanced time would fall away and thoughts would seem to stop I would be making decisions applying techniques adjus ing improving but all without seeming to no is doing so and without thinking about anything else either I seem to be an autopilot this is very common with creatives and adjacent practices like musicians you'll hear a writer saying something like the words just seem to flow through me like I was just a conduit this is what mindfulness is being present or perhaps just being and I've talked about it before the state of focus that you get into when you're fully absorbed in the creative process is called flow and it's a state that most if not all creators spend their time trying to achieve I frequently achieve it when writing these episodes including this one I started off this series assuming that it was going to be a single episode thanks in part to flow I'm in the process of realizing that probably this needs to roll on to yet another episode by just letting my thoughts flow I realized I had a lot more to say on this subject than I'd previously thought this is just another effect of such States when you get out the way of your subconscious when you stop trying to force yourself to think to create it can just spell out naturally and you'll be surprised what you can achieve another aspect of flow is the desire to just keep going to surf that way for as long as possible however I need to get off and give you all a break I've got other things I'm supposed to be doing and the longer the episode the more time it takes to record and produce and all that stuff is much less mindful I've been promising an episode on Flow since I started recording this podcast and now it looks like I might finally get to it I think this is me committing to it and as I've said before I hate disappointing people will it be the next episode I release maybe maybe not you'll just have to turn up and find out I'd also like to expand my thoughts on the probabilistic brain and how this relates to the creation and consumption of art movies TV and the Arts in general that may also get included in the next episode or maybe there will be a fourth part I know the suspense is killing you one last thing having documented my departure from Twitter in the last episode I just joined the ex Nemesis Blue Sky which seems like a much nicer place my handle is Alex Loveless artist once you followed me on there please go and like and repost all of my other posts if you would be so kind this stuff really helps new people find me thanks I'll see you soon
