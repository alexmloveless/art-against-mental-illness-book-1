Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. Welcome back everyone. So I've got a little bit of
housekeeping to do before this episode. So this is my interview with Caitlin Hannah. It was recorded
just before Christmas last year, 2024 and so some of the references in here talk about things that
happened for example November last year. So just bear in mind that refers to November 2023.
This conversation gets quite emotive so I need to do some content warnings. During this discussion
we touch on issues like cancer, the death of a loved one, grief, disability, some description of
surgery, medications, chronic mental illness, suicide and probably some other stuff that I
missed. So if that stuff's going to traumatize you then maybe skip this one. But despite all that I
think this episode has a really positive message so I hope you enjoy it and I'll see you again soon.
I'm here in the Perth Creative Exchange with Caitlin Hannah. I've known Caitlin for a couple of years
you think? Yeah, couple of years. We've exhibited together in the various exhibitions I've done
around this area and so I'm really pleased to welcome Caitlin. Caitlin do you want to introduce
yourself? Yeah, so I'm Caitlin Hannah. I am a contemporary artist and I kind of say that my
work's all just like emotional vomit onto a page because it's all kind of surrounding my lived
experiences with mental health, grief, kind of just how I've existed in the universe and seen things.
So yeah I kind of do mixed media stuff like well my work tends to be different. I've been doing a
lot of paintings lately but it all tends to be kind of the media that fits kind of the vibes that
I'm trying to do or put across. So I'm just looking around me at your walls and so I see some stuff
on canvases, some stuff on paper, lots of different mediums, a combination of almost cartoonish
imageries and writing and in fact some embroidery. And so I think one thing you and I have in common
is we tend to put textual elements to our artworks. You want to tell us about you know how that comes
together for you? Yeah so I've been doing art for kind of, I don't know, my entire life and
I kind of stumbled onto text in art from like artist I admire so like Jenny Holzer, Tracey
Emman, Louise Bourgeois, stuff like that. And I kind of see putting text in art as
kind of an inclusive element because I think you could get messages across clearer if in a in a
written way but also kind of a little bit like the work is poetry, the work is honesty, the work is
it's got my handwriting in it, it's got my like artist techniques in it, it's got like I've got
a piece that's just biropen and it's this is too much written just over and over and over again
and because it's kind of, I don't know, it's it's art in itself like the the vomit and the feeling
in it but then the text is also, it just explains things I think a little. So the repetition thing
is something I'm also very familiar with I think so we're both autistic right and I have phrases,
motifs, bits of music, bits of things that people have said to me that are on like sample loops in
my head and it changes all the time and I'll attach on to a slogan or something. It might
be something meaningful, it might be complete nonsense, I've got so many utterly nonsense
things that get jammed in my head and I don't really understand why and so I can really relate
to that and where you've said this is too much I'm presuming that was a fairly emotional moment
for you when you did that. Yeah well I think it kind of was a lot of things going on in that time
like I like you said I'm autistic so I was really overwhelmed by everything that was going on, all
the little jobs that I had to do and all that and then there's the mental health side as well
of just actually I've not been well and like dealing with not being mentally well is a lot
and then I've been going through a lot of grief as well and that's a lot so then it's kind of
everything in but I do catch like little phrases and I think I always have like a standout text
in a work and there might be little background text like written in and stuff but I think it is
it's like the catchphrase and it gets stuck in my head and it needs to like come out and it can be
played on as well so with the embroidery I've got she comes not back his house stands empty
but that's from a Euripides Greek tragic play thing okay and if he comes not back his house
stands empty and I kind of played, I changed a pronoun but yes like fiddling with things
I think it's fun as well. So we're gonna talk about grief depending on what
of your what you're looking at it comes across as very very prominent and the one you just mentioned
I think is very directly related to that do you want to tell us about would you mind describing
yeah so that is it's a in a box frame it's a black it's a black canvas but on printed onto
the canvas is a brain scan like an MRI scan of it's actually my mum's brain and in the brain you
can see a tumor and you can also see the swelling in the brain as well so the white there's white
wispies that are swelling and onto that print kind of of the brain I've embroidered the shape of the
brain tumor so it stands out in like a dark red and then also next to it I've embroidered she
comes not back his house stands empty and so and just to accentuate this the white patches that I
mean there's a lot of that right so I think anyone would be able to tell that was not a healthy brain
yeah do you want to just tell us a bit about what happened there yeah so kind of my mum a few years
ago there's a whole background story she was diagnosed with esophageal cancer stage three
which is apparently usually just a death sentence but she got put in this this medical trial at
Dundee Uni where they were starting a new therapy and they kind of did a fun funky surgery
and so they gave her immunotherapy and chemo and they also removed her entire esophagus
and to replace it they moved her stomach up so her stomach attached directly to her throat it
was very so she could no longer after that she was never allowed to lie down because she would
her stomach acid would just come into her mouth and she would stop breathing and she survived she
was cancer free in remission which is amazing she that she managed that and she just kind of
paved the way a bit with the immunotherapy and stuff and that this is kind of a treatment but it
did mean for the rest of her life she was never allowed to lie down so she had to sit up to sleep
and everything and she was kind of always in discomfort and pain because of it and then
start of last year she started to act really weird and we were like what is going on with you
Kirsty this isn't this isn't who you are she was struggling to go to work she was struggling to get
out of bed and she was becoming quite childlike in a lot of ways and we got doctors around and
they were like oh she's just depressed and we're like we know depression and we know what that's
like but this isn't it because she wants to be able to get out of bed she wants to go to work
it's not that she wasn't having depressed thoughts she was unable to get her body to move
so she fell over I think she got taken into an ambulance because my dad couldn't get her up
and they did a brain scan and they found this massive tumor that was like a quarter of a brain
and then almost a full half of her brain was swollen from kind of the pressure of that tumor
and they said you've got probably a couple of weeks to a month or two and she had the option of
getting a surgery to try and reduce the tumor to try and buy her more time and so she decided to
go for that so within the next week was that surgery from her diagnosis to kind of the surgery
it was maybe four five days but the when is the day before she was meant to go into the surgery
and she fell over and she couldn't get up again so my dad phoned an ambulance for her and she just
got taken into the ward a day earlier and she was kind of fine she was all good she was still very
weird she was still very childlike she was regretting quite a lot and yes that night we got a phone
call that she was in the high dependency unit and she had brain tumor had hemorrhaged and they were
kind of just looking after her for a bit and they think that she'll still be able to get the surgery
and we went through and saw her and kind of chatted with her and whilst I was in there I was like
this isn't good she's going to die in here and afterwards I explicitly remember my dad and
brother in the car ride home going oh no she's fine we've seen dying people before she's not
dying and I was going she's definitely dying and then the next day when we went in we got told that
she was dying but her kidneys had shut down she was just her whole body was failing her
and she was no longer conscious so she lasted a couple of more days and then yeah that was
that so it was all very fast we had some heads up but it was all very very quick um so this was
this scan is the scan of um when she was initially brought into hospital and they found
that this was the discovery scan and my parents knowing how curious I am got a picture of it to
show me they were like this is what it looks like Caitlin thank you very much I do appreciate this
um and I know like I've used my mum a lot in my art already like in the past you guys close yeah
very close I've got this is um I've got a bust like a moderate bust of my mum's
naked torso just in my house okay so yeah she was just we were very close we were like best friends
and um she was always 100% like with my art and stuff she was like oh no you should totally do
this Caitlin and I was like oh I want to do this bust thing but it's gonna be difficult to do
myself and she's like well just use me Caitlin do that and I'm like okay cool and she was like
I'll lie on the floor and you can pour all this really heavy liquid on top of me and I'm like
sure thank you yeah yeah she was just headfirst into it all so amazing yeah you would not be
convincing me to do that because it obviously was very brave as well yeah she was um so I'm just
looking at these uh we've got these little zines that you've created uh it's just imagine a an
a3 bit of paper that's been very carefully folded up to create a small little booklet
it's been printed but they're covered in um sort of hand-drawn illustrations and
handwritten notes and various um you know very very distinct and different illustrations and
styles what inspired you to to take the the zine form I've been involved with zines on and off
for all my life and I've never seen anything like this this is really quite incredible thank you
um I don't really know what got me into it I think I was I thought I really like zines and
I think they're a very cool way to make art accessible um because they're cheap to make
so therefore cheap to sell um and I know a lot of kind of like my work can be expensive because of
the time and the materials and all of that um so I kind of wanted to do that but I also feel like
it's something that you can take away and keep private um because I have a lot of people that
see my work that say I really resonate with that but actually I don't know if I want it up on my
wall to remind me every day and so this is something that can you can look at and then you
can put it in a drawer and you can put it away and you can breathe and you can kind of do what
you need to do and you don't need to be constantly reminded about that um I'm going to come back to
this that idea in a minute but you want to just read this is the first one I've seen yeah this is
a cover of that so the first on the cover it says grief a zine about death grief and why life is
fucking unbearable and it's got a little rabbit drawn on it like a cartoon rabbit and some
teardrops and crosses yeah and and what sort of things do you cover in that um so in this this
one's all about grief it's about um kind of my relationship about it I think I've got things like
I need saved from this pain and stuff and kind of it's my story and my family's story but then
I've also got like what do I do section because I know when like I've been faced with this I've
been like what what am I what's life gonna be like what do I do from here and actually the answer is
you do whatever the fuck you can do and you just try and get through it and but I wanted that to
be very clear and you need to be gentle with yourself and that you need to endure it even
though it's awful you need to do it there's also a poem in it by Andrea Cohen the committee weighs
in um which is a beautiful poem right it um it's I tell my mother I've won the noble prize again
she says which discipline this time it's a little game we play I pretend I'm somebody she pretends
she isn't dead um and I just think it's a beautiful poem and I think it's also a very nice way to think
about how you endure and what you do to get through yeah and it is quite universal um but also
almost a taboo um and to sort of talk about these things and want to restrict it to grief
you know there's all sorts of um you know difficulties in life they want to all have a better
term and an artist and creativity and really the co-op thesis of this whole podcast is that this
stuff is a good way of dealing with stuff and do you find after you know doing any of these pieces
these scenes and stuff do you feel you know you've lifted yourself a bit like you've exercised some
definitely so that's that's what got me into art in the first place was I was mentally very unwell
as a teenager um I was in the mental health services I've been sectioned a couple of times
I'd made attempts on my life and everything I was very not well um and I kind of used art then as a
way to get everything out so talking about my mother I have a memory of us was buying a massive
canvas and going into like the garden and just throwing ink and everything on it and just
stamping on it and stabbing it and doing what we needed to do to get all of the aggression and
upset out um and kind of since then that's grown in me so I've always taken it with me and I went
on to do it at college and I was like oh but art needs to be pretty pictures now that I'm doing this
in like college or whatever and actually it doesn't it can still be like a throw up so I've
got some paintings here the blue ones you are meant to be here and let me see you again which
was very soon after mum passed that I did those and I was still working in my spare bedroom at home
and there was this still paint on the ceiling and walls because I just had a little moment to
myself and let everything out and had a cry and did what I needed to do um and kind of yeah I find
it's it's a great way even the more controlled pieces it's a great way that I can visualize what
I'm feeling because part of me can accept that I don't feel good but then it doesn't actually
mean anything unless I can see it or name it and I can ever name it without fully talking it through
but I can also paint it out or art it out in some form um so I can now see it and I know that's what
that is and actually I could do without what I want I can tuck it away and never look at it again
I can get rid of it or I could put it on show and say this is how people feel in life at times
yeah and and so you know said that art is is emotional is made solid which I think is
is completely right and and it couldn't be more um present in the studio it's an interesting
point you made about um I like this piece of art but I'm not sure I could have on my walls and it's
a problem I've had quite a lot possibly for quite a few different reasons I've usually got
kind of quite scary like themes or people staring out of my paintings and and you sort of think well
there's this picture of this zombie staring lady and you think well I can see why you don't want
her staring down at you while you're eating your dinner in the dining room but also I I think I've
sort of shied away a bit in in terms of putting too much of my emotions into my work partly because
I think it's quite there's quite a skill to it especially without making it sort of press or
like seeming like attention seeking but also in terms of yeah people people don't really want
that on their walls and I did a lot of thinking about this because I'm like everyone listens to
Amy Winehouse, Kurt Cobain's stuff you know there's sad music everywhere from people who who
died um you know in their in their prime and and you're still listening to that sad song so what's
wrong with this sad painting and I think it's because that sad song is on now when I want it
and then it's gone away when I don't want it and the painting on the wall is there all the time
unless you decide to take it up and down which is not really how people think about art and so I
find that a bit frustrating but also I totally get it and so how do you find that that sort of
um that that paradox that collision between you know emotional art and and you know
art is decor really when it comes down to it. I think it's difficult I'm like I remember having
a conversation with my partner that was like but I don't understand it because if I connect with
something then of course I'd want it on my wall because I've made a connection with that and this
is my space and my partner was like yeah I get that Caitlin but if it's something that you're not
ready to accept or if it's if it's something that like is not who you are like I I'm very
I'm very honest about everything about myself and I don't mind having something up that's like
oh I feel shit because actually that's a part of living um but some people like to live their
little happy lives and live in that bubble and they get sad but then they're like actually I
just allow that for like five minutes and then I put that away again um I think I've been slowly
getting a little bit more into China make make it a bit more pretty um but I kind of do it in a way
that's linked so I've got the two flower pieces there that's kind of a pink painting on paper
with text um kind of in the background of it and it's got one of them's got daisies on it and the
other one is irises or violets um and that's because the daisies is mum's birth flower and the
irises violets is my dad's and I lost my dad last year as well um so these paintings are about kind
of nightmares and stuff that you get from grief and it's about my parents um but actually I've
put some pretty flowers on there that do link because it's their birth flowers but people go
they're very pretty flowers so um and they are and so I'm looking at the painting now up here
it's sold magnificent I don't make good money out of that um it's like a teddy bear um with a moon
and it's got let me see you again uh and to the moon and back in some handwritten um text
and I could see that um that could that could apply to you missing your kid who's gone to
university or something right and in fact this one with you I'm meant to be here so I sort of
feel like it on one hand I know I think I know what these mean I certainly get an idea because
I know you but I think other people would would not maybe take that away from it and I think that's
what's powerful is that you know there's these are not um whimsical paintings you know they're
clearly serious and it's expressive but you could read actually probably a broadly positive messaging
yeah I think so I think that's part of the reason why I like having a snippet of text as well because
people can read it so differently and it can give so many different kind of answers um and if I keep
kind of the text as vague as possible then it can fit into other people's lives um so I know
with the you were meant to be here they'll let me see you again to the moon and back um I had
somebody ask me if I'd had a miscarriage and I was like I have not but that's very interesting
that that's where that goes for you with the vagueness people can slot themselves into it
yeah and I've talked about this quite a lot in that when when this first started happening to me
um I was like no no you've got it wrong you know I mean let me correct you it's not about the thing
you just said and and then I was like well no wait no it's not like that at all that that person has
superimposed their own story they've taken the wrong thing away they've they've added to the
artwork they've made it something new and there's always a little part of me that's like no but you
understand that I was you know feeling like this and feeling like that it's good if people know
that and they can relate to it but also it's not a deal breaker and and in fact for me it enriches
the piece and um and I think in terms of sort of putting your emotions out there um you've got to
you've got to also let go of them and this goes back to your point about sort of making um emotions
solid as a way of almost putting them on the shelf I give this emotion to you but this emotion
means something different and so so last year or maybe the last year has been quite challenging
yeah um probably an understatement but I also find myself sitting in a studio yeah in a in a in a
the creative exchange is like a hub for creatives in in Perth Scotland um you you got a grant yeah
I got a grant for the studio um which is kind of paid for a few quite a few months actually
but kind of the shared studio space that I have um and it's been really great and along with doing
that comes up other opportunities so then I could take part in Persia Open Studios or
the markets during this building or I've actually just been accepted for an exhibition downstairs
in July so yeah the last few years have been really difficult but I've got so much out of the
last year as well with this space and actually even just the perspective of I just need to do
what I want to do and I need to do what makes me happy so I'm going to sit in this room and I'm
going to make myself little paintings but I enjoy it wholeheartedly I mean it reads like a a bit of
a novel in a sense so we've got the first second third act here and um and hopefully this is this
is the happy ending no falling off into the sunset but yeah I mean you're so lucky to have this um
but I wouldn't wish what you've been through um on anyone at all but you said your dad died as well
yeah so he died in November last year so it was six months after mum um and not a clue what
happened he he was a musician so he had just been away to Holland for a week gigging and he'd come
back and he got COVID um and I was like well I'm not going to come around and see him because
I don't want COVID you can suffer on your own um on the Saturday he tested positive and then
on the Monday he wasn't answering any of my phone calls um so I went around and me and my brother
were banging on the doors like just thinking that he was unwell in bed um my brother even climbed up
to his bedroom window and knocked on it and there was no sign to be got the police around and he was
just found in bed um so the coroner's report just said COVID so they didn't do an autopsy because
because it's COVID so so yeah that was very unexpected totally okay yeah well um
I have my condolences well interestingly my my uneasy response to this brings me straight
onto my next point and uh I think you know neurodivergent people autistic people grieve
very differently um and also we have our challenges with uh social interactions it's always more
comfortable with me talking about difficult issues with autistic people because they don't
look at me like I'm nuts when I don't respond in the way that I'm supposed to and generally I don't
know what to say right and and I'm not good at this and I won't pretend to be I'll try my best
I don't want to offend anyone but um you know I just wanted to sort of revisit uh you know how
your neurodiversity is neurodivergence has sort of affected your journey and whether you think it
you know I can see that it probably contributed to some of your problems and I can also see that
it's a big driver in terms of your positive creative outlook um I don't know so I was diagnosed
as autistic when I was like 14 and I was like well that's not true that's a lie because I'm not
like incredibly disabled by this experience so that's clearly not true using making that up
as an excuse because I was unwell and I was like that's that that's the reason you suspect for me
not going to school because I didn't attend high school it definitely contributed a lot because I
did not have formal education because of the fact that going to school was an overwhelming experience
for me and I didn't realize at the time that's what that was but looking back I'm like actually
all those times I did that and that and that that was clearly because it was autistic and overwhelmed
so actually the professionals were correct and they can do that sometimes yeah so I think
it's contributed a lot to that it's contributed to kind of how I fit in the world sometimes I feel
really awkward so what you were saying about not knowing what to say if somebody gives me condolences
I'm like yeah well it's fine and then it's like well actually it's not fine but then
like I don't know what to say to that someone walks up and say how you doing Caitlin and you'll give
them four minutes worth of monologue about how crap your day's been or something yeah really
I'm like I don't know what to say I'll just say whatever comes to my head at the time
um but it's also been it's been weirdly a blessing to kind of have it or have the label for sure
because sadly it gives me a lot more opportunities in the art world because I'm like applying for
things and I'm like well I'm autistic and mentally I'm well and my life's gonna shit and then like
well you deserve to have this grant then for the studio and I'm like well I don't really deserve it
more than anybody else does but I will accept that and I will use this word as a kind of play to
to do what I need to do so but it does it I don't know it it gives and it takes in its own way there
are days that I can't come in because um I've really struggled with the wind so if it's really
windy outside I really can't cope like sensory wise with it so I'm like well actually I can't
come into the studio today because it's really windy and it's gonna make me want to scream
and I've got other things that make me want to scream so this is too much screaming for me to
be in public um but then in the flip side it's like well it gives me the space to be able to
actually concentrate on this fully and to also not have any boundaries in place when I do it
I think I think it really helps that I'm autistic to the fact that I can just spew all this out
because there's no social boundary in place I'm not thinking about what will this like what other
people look like for other people I'm just like this is my truth yeah I've uh I used to find
other people in my head when I was in my studio or whatever and it really I found it really
crippling because I would be like why is anyone gonna love this what is this crap it's rubbish
why am I doing this no one's ever going to want a lot look at this and on the flip side I was
saying well I only do this uh for sort of for therapy so why does it matter whether anyone
likes it or not and I've got to the point now where I'm so annoyed by that voice in my head
I've started to just film everything like works in progress any old crap and stick it on YouTube
it's like just get out there because it's stuck on my sexism of demons um and you can't have
people in your head when you're creating it's such an impediment because also it's nonsense as well
so many times I'm like oh this is crap this thing I'm making someone sees it and goes that's
absolutely incredible and you know you make up what people say in your head and then the reality is
that's not what they think at all yeah well even with referring back to the it's too much thing I
did that and I was like that's mental how's anybody gonna look at that and go that's art that's
that's worth money but then actually when I put it up I had so many good reactions to that yeah
I love it it's like a bit side tumbly like a tiny little side tom you know side tumbly
does it's the one with the massive canvases where it just scribbles bits on it and I sort of see
that that sort of um parallel between sort of um doodles and writing and in your work it I don't
I don't think they're comfortable on many levels not least because that's like uh 27 is across and
is like 20 feet across but um it does evoke that a little bit for me and and and there's the um
insects so last time I was here so I'm looking at a painting that has um some handwriting up on
the back there's still must have been sort of smudged out and then a little little spider that
I don't know if I think that's creepy or not I kind of call him robo spider I think he looks
like he's made up of like excessive like excess bits of metal in the workshop yeah it's almost
kind of endearing and and then when I was in here before didn't you have like a load of slugs
yeah so I do have loads of tiny slugs um some with fairy wings some with like pride flags and stuff
like that yeah so spiders I'm all right with spiders they're useful animals and they don't
bother me that much slugs I really can't cope with um but yours were actually quite cute thank you
the wise slugs I don't know I I think partly I really started liking them because I was like
nobody else seems to like them and somebody has to like them so I was like I'll be that person
and then kind of what I've learned about them or I guess how I've grown as a as a human as well
that I'm like I've just got so much like empathy for these little creatures that just they only
come out when it's dark and when it's wet and they're just living the little lives and then
I think it was a couple weeks ago I was like well actually they're just little artists as well
because they have the little slime trails and actually they paint beautiful glistening pictures
which show but it also shows their journey as well which is like what I'm doing in my paintings
little silk trails yeah it's I don't know if I think about it I started to like them because
nobody likes them but then I've just the more I think about them the more I'm like
they're just little guys and they are very curious like if you have a snail or a slug in your hands
they will I have I've had them like look up at my face like who are you and I'm like
just a person just trying my best but um they're very cool I think and also just like lots of
things about them like how they reproduce is very cool I don't know if we're going to go into that
yeah yeah go look at heart people yeah I doubt I'm going to start finding slugs and dairying but
you know certainly made me feel a little less disturbed by them um the other the other thing
that happened last time I came here is I think we we spent about 20 minutes talking about medication
yeah that was like oh god knows it was people in the next room what they must have thought when
we were comparing meds because I take about well that's probably five six seven pills most days
not every day and I mean that's seven different flavors of pill I have um you know my my ADHD meds
I'm on the quick release so I take about between six and eight of those a day and then all the
other pills and uh I think we were just laughing about all of the you know the drugs that we've
prescribed um because you got it right yeah you do I think I think it's funny I also think it's
really odd how quickly they can prescribe drugs as well though I so I got diagnosed with fibromyalgia
um this year um and there's like two medications that you can take or something one of them's
pre-gabble and the other one I can't remember its name but it's an antidepressant it's a tricylic
and I'm already on a tricylic anti-depressant so like well that means you can't take that so you
just got to hope pre-gabble and that's like this is all so weird why can't I don't know it all just
feels bizarre I mean pre-gabble in is has got serious street value like it's proper proper stuff
I joke that my bedside table is like worth so much money god yeah and I've got my ADHD
D-med to dex amphetamine which gave me that street value and when I go to the um the chemist to pick
them up they have to get the pharmacist to take them out of the safe yeah I just think it I think
it's part of our personality that we we just find it funny and you sort of find that and with anyone
with chronic illnesses or conditions or whatever that um there's always a funny side to it yeah
because you got a laugh right I think as well like when when life deals you maybe like a
non-typical hand um with like chronic illness neurodiversity is mental health you it's like
that has to be funny yeah you know what I mean it's like there's I don't I don't know how to word
but it's almost like your your reality is so different and shifts from the typical that
actually it's all just a bit ridiculous at times yeah well what is comedy is is is calling out
either ridiculous things or creating ridiculous situations why is multi-piphon funny because it
it's bizarre but there's there's a flavor of reality in there and and I think it's the same
and I also think that autistic people generally have delayed emotional responses
and and so you know for a long time people told me really bad news or something I would laugh
because it would be like yeah cool because I need that as well well done thanks yeah cheers
I have such a strong memory of my mom saying that her aunt died and me laughing at her face as a kid
she was like Caitlin you need to leave the room right yeah yeah yeah I mean it it's just I think
a lot of autistic people have been through that and you have to learn the appropriate behavior
because it doesn't come naturally to us it doesn't mean we're not we're not feeling pain or grief or
whatever it's just that you know when my dad died when I was like 20 um I didn't grieve for like
four months I just got straight back into life and was like you know what what is happening I
don't seem to care but I did care and and it affected me for decades after that not because
I bottled it up just because I I processed it yeah and and I know that now but I felt very
guilty about that you know I mean um but I know now that my response was normal to me and uh
and you sort of have to get used to a different normal yeah you do you totally do because like
for the night dad died we had to get um like the police chief to come around because it was
outside of working hours or whatever and they were discussing like the removal of getting him
downstairs and everything like that and I was there like just chucking out the window he's not
gonna feel that and they were like looking at me like what the fuck yeah and my brother was like
she's it's okay this is just Caitlin or like we were told by the police what had happened
I panicked cried for like a second and then I turned to my brother and I was like oh my god
we're like um oh my god we're like all of a twist now that was what I said because we were orphans
and he was like what the fuck Caitlin let's go have a cigarette and I was like I would love that
actually yeah thank you yeah yeah you just react differently yeah yeah our dad has been
my little sister has had our dad's ashes like what's that 30 years has been dead and she has
and they just sit on that medical piece and and that's that's her way of processing you know I
mean okay so I'm going to bring this to a close this has been really really interesting and
fascinating and your openness is is quite disarming again something we have in common
and I hope that people you know sort of understand and can relate to how we see and how we process
the world and so firstly what are your plans for the next year so I have a less exciting year than
last year yeah definitely have a chill year um I think I just want to make I've got an exhibition
in July um which I'm working towards which is I'm very excited about I've got lots of fun ideas
involving installation type situation um and apart from that I'm just gonna see what happens
I'd like to apply for more exhibitions I want to be seen more I think and just yeah talk to
folk as well I enjoy like like this session like I think I want to do more things like this and
yeah you definitely should um that that will I'll be putting on some exhibitions at some point so
maybe we'll exhibit together again yeah that would be good um and where can people find you
so you can find me on Instagram Facebook if you type in Wild I art you'll be able to find me there
I've also got a website which is wildiart.co.uk I think and um you can find my email address there
I'm putting together a newsletter and stuff too so if you contact me in any form I'll write your
info down and add it to the list. And what's the significance of Wild I art? Um such a good
question I when I first started this as like a business I was like oh well I need to be like
all the TikTok people and I need to have like a branded name and I was like I don't like my name
because um I'm non-binary and I was like I wasn't sure if I was gonna keep Caitlin as a name and
everything. I have eyes a lot in my work and I have for years um and I think my work's a bit
wild at times um and it's art it's a Wild I art. There you go well that was that I mean honestly
that was as about as lucid an explanation as anyone ever gives me yeah the last person I
interviewed when I asked him you know about his art he he basically couldn't explain it to me
and it took him about 10 minutes to not explain it to me so um you're in good shape nice okay
brilliant well thank you for your time maybe you'll come back on again and we'll get an update
but otherwise I'll see you we'll exhibit at some point thanks for having me thank you for coming
