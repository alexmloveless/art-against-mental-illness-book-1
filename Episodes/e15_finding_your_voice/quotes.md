# Episode 15: Finding Your Voice - Significant Quotes

## Identity and Voice Formation

> "However he stated my disabilities have not been a hindrance that have shaped my life and made me who I am. In every possible sense his disabilities were part of his voice and everything he became. He was a one-off but then we all are."

> "Voices are important in terms of our identity and how we are perceived. Just go ask Morgan Freeman. But voices come in many forms not just the noises that come out of our mouth hole."

## Universal Impossibility and Cultural Diversity

> "Even people from roughly the same background and worldview may have some overlapping tastes but still quite divergent often radically so and therefore the idea that you can make a piece of art that is universally liked is ludicrous. It's just not possible."

> "This is all awesome and as it should be because if everyone likes anything that anyone makes the world would be a boring place and no progress would ever happen. There would be little or no novelty and beauty wouldn't exist."

> "So now we have legions of English-speaking teenage girls worshiping Korean boy bands that sing in a language that they themselves don't speak. This is all marvelous."

## The Algorithm Problem

> "Increasingly these businesses are mediating what people see. This has a countering effect on the diversification of culture since these networks have algorithms that are optimized to make money for their owners and therefore will favor one creator over another in the competition for eyeballs and attention in such ways to maximize revenues."

## Finding Your Tribe

> "So not only do you not have to please everyone you just need to find your tribe and please them. It's not exactly easy to do this but it is thanks to the interwebs possible and when you find them they will support you. How do you please them though perhaps even before you find them? Easy please yourself since by definition you are one of them."

## Demystifying the Creative Process

> "From an observer's perspective ideas and creations are magic unicorn poo that flows from some mystical esoteric inspiration gland using the creator merely as a conduit. But here's how it actually works."

> "You pick a starting point and maybe an end point or a sense of an end point. You do some stuff to move you away from your starting point and towards your end point. You pause and consider what you've done and make a value judgment. That value judgment is always do I like where this is going?"

> "By this measure creation is always a labor of love."

## Voice Definition and Examples

> "The way that you are distinct from others is called your voice. Sometimes it's called style but it's more than that. It's about how you choose your subject which medium and materials you use and how you wield them, size, shape, color, textures, word choice, phrasing, where you choose to display it, when."

> "My point is in terms of Banksy's voice it's the where and the why that really counts here as much as the what."

> "Young's work is aggressively situational. I'm afraid you just had to be there so the major component of his voice is when and arguably for sanity's sake how bloody long?"

> "Their voice was channeling What If or maybe as stated on the song's Wikipedia page Wouldn't it be funny if?"

## Voice as Individual Expression

> "Your voice is like your fingerprint, your handwriting, the pattern of your iris. It's something that's individual to you, it's part of your makeup, of your genetics and your upbringing, your culture and so on. It's the essence of you projected onto the real world via an object or a song or a video game or whatever."

> "Your voice only expresses what you are as a creator. It differentiates you from other creators and gives a reason for people to like your stuff more or less than someone else's."

## Flow and Voice Connection

> "You know when you're listening to your voice when you're expressing what your inner voice wants to express because you're pleased with what you create because it gives you joy to experience it, it gives you joy to make it."

> "Flow is what happens when your skills are in line with your ambitions or goals. Voice is what emerges when your output matches the complex mesh of desires that you have in your head. These two work in tandem as you evolve as a creator."

> "Flow happens when you get out of the way of your subconscious. Voice in turn naturally emerges when you do so."

## The Emulation Challenge

> "One of the biggest barriers to finding your voice is distinguishing between your voice and the voice of other creators that you admire and wish to emulate."

> "The problem with emulating someone else is that you are not them. Your voice is not theirs. The results will always be unsatisfying to produce and will ultimately come up short."

> "You're simply not them. You're not speaking in their voice. You're merely suppressing your own voice in your attempt to channel theirs."

> "This is sometimes hard to recognize but for many creators doing so is that aha moment where they finally feel like they've clicked with their chosen art form or medium."

## Voice Evolution and Development

> "Your voice will start to leak out its small drips as you progress. Ultimately having a stronger grasp on your medium gives you the confidence to experiment and push boundaries, giving you more freedom to depart from your beloved roots, like a child gaining independence from her parents."

> "You've not left your old world behind. It's still there. It's just been expanded to incorporate new things. So by increments, some larger than others, your work evolves. This is simply a process of your voice emerging and evolving."

## Personal Journey Example

> "How did I get from swords and dragons to where I am now? I just followed my voice which means I did things that pleased me and gave me satisfaction to do so. The little artist in my head became the big artist IRL and given how restless and prolific I am my evolution is usually pretty frequent and pretty obvious to me at least."

## Sophistication vs. Satisfaction

> "Some would say that as you progress your work becomes more sophisticated and more mature but I think this view is very limited and a little condescending. I think the pressure to grow as a creator often comes at the expense of satisfaction and fulfillment."

> "Why make free-form jazz when you love electropunk? Why make abstract expressionism when you love comics? Sophistication is the fastest of a style or a medium not something intrinsic and universal and beauty is in the eye of the beholder."

> "I would rate Alan Moore's genre defining graphic superhero novel Watchmen higher than classics by Hardy or F. Scott Fitzgerald both in terms of artistic merit and social observation."

## Audience and Criticism

> "And that brings us back to where we started. You can't please everyone. So if you please yourself you're in a voice you will find an audience who that also pleases. And those who don't like or are indifferent to your work are simply not your audience."

> "The criticisms are no more valid to you than a food critic having views on veterinary science. They are different domains. You don't take your dog to the vet and tell them how to treat it."

> "Protect your voice but listen for signals within the noise for how to let more of your voice shine."

## Impact Beyond Pleasing

> "Some people produce art specifically to annoy certain groups and sometimes all people. It's the case of many artists that the only disappointing response to their work is indifference. If someone despises your work then you've had a serious impact in their world."

> "You've got them emoting. You've got them thinking and talking about you. You're creeping around in their head leaving grimy footprints and handprints everywhere."

## Commercial Considerations

> "So although your job as an artist is to own your voice that doesn't mean you can't tailor your output for the broadest possible audience. It's perhaps a slightly slippery slope if you let this go too far and get caught in a commercial rut especially if you find some success."

> "If like me you view your art primarily as a therapeutic outlet it's especially tricky. I need money but I also need my mental health if I'm going to make money. Perhaps I could make more money if I sacrifice my creative freedom but would I also be sacrificing some of the therapeutic value?"

## Practical Wisdom

> "My wretchedly hopeful mantra these days is just keep turning up. It's a bit like the whole build it and they will come thing. I think that if I just keep pushing my working people's faces they'll eventually take pity on me and buy something or maybe I'm just ahead of my time."

## Five Tips for Finding Voice

> "First you've got to set aside time just to create as mindfully as possible and to follow your nose as it were and work on things that you want to work on from day one."

> "Second spend some time bathing in your influences and try and figure out what it is about them that really draws you to them. What is the essence of their voice?"

> "Third try not to judge yourself too harshly and recognise when you're judging yourself by someone else's standards. Figure out where your own standards lie and what good looks like for you. If it feels right it probably is right."

> "Fourth understand where your core capabilities your strength and weaknesses lie. Work with the tools that you've got physical, psychological, economic, environmental."

> "Fifth find beauty in your own work by trusting yourself let your voice emerge by getting out of its way. Finding your voice is as much about blocking other people's voices it's as much about not listening to critics of not judging yourself by yardsticks of culture or society and to trust your own instincts."

## Final Authority: Art and Fear

> "The artistic evidence for the constancy of interior issues is everywhere. It shows in the way most artists return to the same two or three stories again and again. It shows in the palette of Van Gogh the characters of Hemingway the orchestration of your favorite composer."

> "The only work really worth doing the only work that you can do convincingly is the work that focuses on the things you care about. To not focus on those issues is to deny the constants in your life."

## Closing Thought

> "I create these episodes when a particular subject tickles my pickles so you'll just have to turn up and see what happens next."
