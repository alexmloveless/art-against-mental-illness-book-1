Welcome to the Art Against Mental Illness podcast. My name is Alex Loveless and this is my podcast
about the healing powers of art for artists, art lovers, the art curious and anyone with an
interest in mental health and well-being. In 1985 Stephen Hawking finally lost his ability to speak.
From then on he communicated verbally via a text-to-speech device called the equalizer
that was attached to his wheelchair and controlled initially by his hand and later by his cheek
muscle when he lost the use of his hand. The device spoke in that now iconic robotic American
accent despite the fact that Hawking was English. At various points later in his life he was given
the opportunity to change the voice but refused stating he preferred this and identified with it.
It's also fair to say that he was instantly recognizable because of that voice. Voices are
important in terms of our identity and how we are perceived. Just go ask Morgan Freeman.
But voices come in many forms not just the noises that come out of our mouth hole.
Hawking was intensely creative and was responsible for some of the most important
discoveries in science yet he was profoundly disabled. However he stated my disabilities
have not been a hindrance that have shaped my life and made me who I am. In every possible sense
his disabilities were part of his voice and everything he became. He was a one-off but then
we all are. Humans have very different personalities, different lives, different lifestyles,
physiologies, worldviews, upbringings, cultures, prejudices, beliefs and therefore they tend to
have different tastes. Even people from roughly the same background and worldview may have some
overlapping tastes but still quite divergent often radically so and therefore the idea that you can
make a piece of art that is universally liked is ludicrous. It's just not possible. This is all
awesome and as it should be because if everyone likes anything that anyone makes the world would
be a boring place and no progress would ever happen. There would be little or no novelty and
beauty wouldn't exist. Culture emerges through variety and variety isn't distributed uniformly
through culture. In statistics you have a concept of the normal distribution often referred to as
the bell curve. This is when you take measurements across a population and create a chart that shows
how many people have each measurement, the measurement being along the x-axis. Google it,
you'll recognize the distinctive bell shape. The obvious example is adult heights. You have a small
number of very short people and the same for very tall people in between all the heights of the
everyday folk around you. This makes a bell shape with the average height being bang in the middle.
What this tells us is the majority of people cluster around a relatively small number of
heights. The same goes for shoe size, IQ and any number of other measures. This is a basic
statistical reality, a fact of the universe. There's all sorts out there but mostly if you
zoom out and look at them on mass people are pretty similar. This goes for culture too. There's a huge
diversity of creative outputs out there. Go poke around Spotify and you'll find an insane number
of artists and mind-boggling array of styles and genres. However despite the quality of their music
Cosmic Progressive Death Metal Band Blood Incantation are not selling out 10 shows at
Wembley Stadium whereas Taylor Swift is. Go figure. I can recommend the new Blood Incantation album.
It's really rather good. I've not heard the new Swift album though. I'm sure she'll go over it.
Like human heights there is a middle ground of stuff that's more common and ubiquitous.
Stuff that's considered to be more socially and culturally desirable sees more exposure and
therefore more engagement than the esoteric stuff. This is just simple statistics. Where there is
variance there is both uniformity and extremes. These days there are eight billion people on the
surface of this little wet rock we call earth. Most of which are perpetually wired into this
thing called the internet where they spend their time swapping cultures and really mixing things
up. So now we have legions of English-speaking teenage girls worshiping Korean boy bands that
sing in a language that they themselves don't speak. This is all marvelous. Along with the
prevalent or popular culture wherever you find yourself there are a million microcultures that
are like a gumbo with ingredients from across the cultural spectrum. These are cooked up as
all different flavors of weirdo seek each other out and celebrate their shared oddity. And these
little or sometimes huge cliques sprout new sub cliques which then sprout their own tendrils
and so on. As I say marvelous. As we discover more things more technology more about the human mind
more about the universe and the world around us new inputs come in new people have new ability to
create even more strange new things and form cultures around them. So for anyone looking
to scratch a cultural itch there's a hell of a lot of it out there to choose from now.
The flip side to this from the point of view of the creator is that on one hand there's eight
billion potential eyeballs on the other hand those eyeballs are bombarded with diverse and manifold
choices for things that they can consume. And therefore it's quite hard to reach your potential
audience especially since the arrival of things like social networks Instagram particularly but
now TikTok YouTube Netflix and so on. Increasingly these businesses are mediating what people see.
This has a countering effect on the diversification of culture since these networks have algorithms
that are optimized to make money for their owners and therefore will favor one creator over another
in the competition for eyeballs and attention in such ways to maximize revenues. This tends to
favor creators and influencers that are already very popular and squeeze out niche players so
the majority of people are exposed to only a small sliver of the global melange. Unless you're lucky
enough to be able and inclined to make stuff that pleases the algorithms and therefore the
middle ground you need to seek out your audience your clique. So not only do you not have to please
everyone you just need to find your tribe and please them. It's not exactly easy to do this
but it is thanks to the interwebs possible and when you find them they will support you. How
do you please them though perhaps even before you find them? Easy please yourself since by definition
you are one of them. Actually it's kind of hard to make stuff that doesn't please you since how do
you know if you've produced something good? You like it? This is not a facetious point and perhaps
not as obvious as it seems. From an observer's perspective ideas and creations are magic unicorn
poo that flows from some mystical esoteric inspiration gland using the creator merely
as a conduit. But here's how it actually works. You pick a starting point and maybe an end point
or a sense of an end point. You do some stuff to move you away from your starting point and
towards your end point. You pause and consider what you've done and make a value judgment.
That value judgment is always do I like where this is going? Is this moving towards my ideal
end point in a way that I find pleasing? You come up with an answer and either carry on as you were
or make the requisite adjustments and then continue. You then repeat this process until
you either reach your desired end point or you judge that making further changes would make you
like it less. That's it. No unicorns in sight. How quickly you get from A to B and how much effort
it takes is largely dictated by how difficult your end point is to achieve and how much skill you
have in your medium. And assuming you like the finished product you're likely to decide to
repeat the whole process again perhaps with some adjustments based on what you learned from the last
one. How do you choose your start and end point? You find something you like and you try to
emulate that and ideally add a flourish of your own. By this measure creation is always a labor
of love. Over time by repeating this process you start to create things that are different enough
from your initial inspirations that they are completely new both to you and the world. Your
outputs are different from other artists maybe just a little bit or maybe by a lot. The way that
you are distinct from others is called your voice. Sometimes it's called style but it's more than
that. It's about how you choose your subject which medium and materials you use and how you
wield them, size, shape, color, textures, word choice, phrasing, where you choose to display it,
when. Take the works of Banksy. They're not particularly technically difficult. The
compositions are simplistic if beautifully and impactfully stylized. Really though the point
isn't the designs themselves. In 2005 Banksy created a series of murals on the West Bank wall
that divides Israel from the Palestinian territories within that depict among other things
holes in the wall revealing photorealistic idyllic landscapes in front of which children play as well
as his iconic silhouette of a girl being lifted by a cluster of balloons. He was making a statement
about what that wall represents and one that was only impactful because of where he put them.
My point is in terms of Banksy's voice it's the where and the why that really counts here as
much as the what. American avant-garde composer and performance artist Lamont Young generally
thought of as the father of minimalism composed long like six hours long hyper sparse musical
pieces for various instruments in the 1960s. These he played during lengthy live performances
accompanied by light shows. He's credited with inspiring David Bowie in The Velvet Underground
among others and collaborated with John Cale a member of the latter. I'll point you towards
some of his recordings if there were any. Well there are a few and I mean a few even the scores
are hard to come by. This isn't an accident. Young largely refused to allow his performances to be
recorded or released and keeps his scores under wraps while also frequently changing them. He
takes legal action against anyone who tries to perform or make his work available in any way.
Young's work is aggressively situational. I'm afraid you just had to be there so the major
component of his voice is when and arguably for sanity's sake how bloody long? At the other end
of the scale in terms of musical extremity in 1986 Brummee Grindcore legends Napalm Death recorded
a track called You Suffer which comprised of a blast of chaotic drums and distorted guitars
accompanied by the shouted lyrics You Suffer but Why and is exactly 1.316 seconds long.
The track holds a world record for the shortest song and Rolling Stone ranked the song at number
72 on their 100 greatest heavy metal songs of all time list. Napalm Death at some points would play
the track 30 times in a row live just for a laugh and still taunt audiences with it today by playing
it unannounced and then berating the audience for not keeping up. Their voice was channeling What If
or maybe as stated on the song's Wikipedia page Wouldn't it be funny if? Yoko Ono's 1964
performance artwork Cut Piece involved her kneeling on a stage in Tokyo and inviting the
audience to come and cut bits of her clothes off. This is before she married one of the most famous
humans of all time John Lennon with whom she later participated in an artwork Come Protest
where they spent two weeks in a hotel bed and invited folks to come and view them.
There's quite a lot to be extrapolated from Ono's work but she very much traded in the who.
Another of Ono's works I absolutely love is one of her so-called instruction pieces
which are created for the viewer to perform. Many of these are distributed via books like 1964's
Grapefruit which contains 200 such pieces. The one I really love called Lightning Piece is simply
an instruction. Light a match and watch it till it goes out. Lighting a match and watching it is a
sensory delight for all the senses and it's so fleeting and beautiful. The piece is a zen
inspired reminder to take some time to experience the simple beautiful things. Via this and similar
pieces her voice is expressed by who, in this case you, what, where and when and includes
components of smell, touch and even pain if you happen to be holding a match when it reaches its
conclusion. My point is not that you should become an abstract performance artist although if that's
what your inner artist is telling you then crack on. My point is that artistic voice can manifest
in an essentially infinite number of ways, many of which transcend simple materials, instruments,
subjects etc and if you are to be able to free your true artistic self then you need to allow
yourself to be free to do that voodoo that you do. Your voice only expresses what you are as a creator.
It differentiates you from other creators and gives a reason for people to like your stuff
more or less than someone else's. It's arguable that the voice is art and this is more important
than simply a matter of being original. If you want to grab the attention of audiences that are
awash with other voices trying to grab it then you need to have a distinctive voice and that voice
is something that comes from deep inside you and it's not something that can be taught from reading
books or by emulating someone else. That might help you hone your technique and your craftsmanship
and your mastery but it's really only paving to the path to more interesting places.
Your voice is like your fingerprint, your handwriting, the pattern of your iris. It's
something that's individual to you, it's part of your makeup, of your genetics and your upbringing,
your culture and so on. It's the essence of you projected onto the real world via an object or a
song or a video game or whatever. This all seems a bit abstract and mystical especially if you're
just starting out and you haven't found your voice yet or even figured out what it means to do so.
It's not even very easy to define in concrete terms let alone tell you how to find it
but I can perhaps help you figure out where to look for it. You know when you're listening to
your voice when you're expressing what your inner voice wants to express because you're pleased
with what you create because it gives you joy to experience it, it gives you joy to make it.
The journey of finding your voice is really a matter of getting to the point where your
ability and craftsmanship matches the needs and the wants of your voice and this process never
really ends. The most experienced creators are usually still chasing that elusive voice,
it's part of the fun and the challenge of the process and as you change as a person, as you
get older, as you acquire more experiences and ingest other world views and meet new people,
as you appreciate new art forms and new approaches and so on, your work continues to evolve and
sometimes you need to learn new tricks to keep up with it. But this often crashes with reality
and the culture and society around you. Your voice can move in and out of phase with the ever mutating
cultural environment. This is often apparent with niche musical artists that appear to sell out,
this is when they change or compromise their sound or style to suit current musical trends.
Their loyal fans might rebel and it's usually perceived an artist chasing the money but perhaps
they're just well attuned to the zeitgeist. The flip side is artists that disappear completely
when they don't keep up with trends. In this case they purely listen to their artistic voice and only
do things that really please them or stick with what they do best. Culture moves on and they don't.
Sometimes if they stick around long enough culture comes back around again. An obvious example of
this is Aussie Rock Stalwart's ACDC who seemed to have survived through multiple instances of such
cycle having barely changed their signature sound from day one. However if you've been successful
the pressure to change both cultural and financial, perhaps from your record label or even your fans,
is huge and doing so without compromising your voice is tricky. I'm getting off track, you get
the point, your voice exists both independently but is affected by and is part of the culture around
you. I can't tell you how to find your own voice but maybe I can help you understand how to hear
that voice and how not to drown it out. I've talked about flow before. It's the state of mind you get
into when you're totally absorbed by an activity and the world seems to fall away. It's a similar
state to meditation and it's a state that most creators spend their whole time chasing. Flow is
what happens when your skills are in line with your ambitions or goals. Voice is what emerges
when your output matches the complex mesh of desires that you have in your head. These two
work in tandem as you evolve as a creator. Flow happens when you get out of the way of your
subconscious. Voice in turn naturally emerges when you do so. You can only really achieve flow when
your mastery is of a sufficient level to achieve what your voice desires. Therefore you need to
practice to achieve either. One of the biggest barriers to finding your voice is distinguishing
between your voice and the voice of other creators that you admire and wish to emulate.
It might be hard to recognize your own voice since from an artistic perspective
our voice is made up of a patchwork of environmental, cultural and genetic influences
and the cultural aspects of that involves other people's work. We seek to emulate our heroes,
which is natural and healthy. That's how art propagates and progresses. If you start to create
it's usually because you've encountered some work that you love so much that you feel compelled to
emulate it. So inevitably your work starts out somewhat derivative or even outright copying
at least to the degree that you're able. You don't have a lot of choice about this.
You like what you like. There's no shame in this at all. You have to start somewhere after all.
Your influences will remain a part of the fingerprint of your voice long after you've moved on.
But to be taken seriously as a creator you must progress and differentiate. The problem with
emulating someone else is that you are not them. Your voice is not theirs. The results will always
be unsatisfying to produce and will ultimately come up short. It may seem like your influence's
voice is the same as yours but it never is. Most creators figure out this pretty quickly because
it often feels more natural and comfortable to let their own voice emerge. Flow states cannot
emerge when you're constantly falling short of your desired outcome, which will usually be the
case when you emulate someone else's work. You're simply not them. You're not speaking in their
voice. You're merely suppressing your own voice in your attempt to channel theirs. This is sometimes
hard to recognize but for many creators doing so is that aha moment where they finally feel like
they've clicked with their chosen art form or medium. This is not something that happens overnight.
Your voice will start to leak out its small drips as you progress. Ultimately having a stronger grasp
on your medium gives you the confidence to experiment and push boundaries, giving you
more freedom to depart from your beloved roots, like a child gaining independence from her parents.
That same confidence allows you the conviction to share your work with others, thus gaining further
validation and agency to experiment more. As you spread your wings you discover more influences,
ideas, approaches, techniques and incorporate them either consciously or subconsciously into your
work. You've not left your old world behind. It's still there. It's just been expanded to incorporate
new things. So by increments, some larger than others, your work evolves. This is simply a process
of your voice emerging and evolving. Maybe this is via refinement within a particular style or
movement, further towards a pinnacle of craftsmanship and mastery. Maybe this involves one or more
radical shifts and wild diversification. Maybe it's a bit of both. Either way you progress in
increments and probably won't even notice and then one day you look back at all your older works and
realize how far you've come. In my experience artists tend to start off with a fairly narrow
band of influences and are fairly conservative in their development but then broaden out to
experiment with other styles, mediums and subjects before finding their groove and largely sticking
to it after that, maybe with a slower evolution and the odd digression. After all it might well
be that your chosen starting point wasn't actually a good fit for your voice, just a reflection of
the ideas and approaches you'd been exposed to to that point. This is likely the case with those who
start young and simply have less life experience. In this sense the progression is much a correction
as an evolution. My own journey as a creator started with a desire to be a fantasy artist
and emulate the likes of fantasy art legend Boris Vallejo. I've been through many iterations since
then, I'm not even much of a fantasy genre fan and never really was but echoes of it remain in much
of my work to date and I still massively admire his work even if I no longer seek to emulate it
and to be fair I don't think I would be able to if I tried, I'm just not configured that way.
How did I get from swords and dragons to where I am now? I just followed my voice which means I
did things that pleased me and gave me satisfaction to do so. The little artist in my head became the
big artist IRL and given how restless and prolific I am my evolution is usually pretty frequent and
pretty obvious to me at least. Some would say that as you progress your work becomes more sophisticated
and more mature but I think this view is very limited and a little condescending. I think the
pressure to grow as a creator often comes at the expense of satisfaction and fulfillment.
Why make free-form jazz when you love electropunk? Why make abstract expressionism when you love
comics? Sophistication is the fastest of a style or a medium not something intrinsic and universal
and beauty is in the eye of the beholder. After all what's more simplistic than Mark Rothko's
colour-filled paintings? In some worlds that's considered the height of sophistication. I would
rate Alan Moore's genre defining graphic superhero novel Watchmen higher than classics by Hardy or
F. Scott Fitzgerald both in terms of artistic merit and social observation. We develop
sophistication and maturity within our medium and we look to please those who love what we love.
And that brings us back to where we started. You can't please everyone. So if you please yourself
you're in a voice you will find an audience who that also pleases. And those who don't like or are
indifferent to your work are simply not your audience. The criticisms are no more valid to
you than a food critic having views on veterinary science. They are different domains. You don't take
your dog to the vet and tell them how to treat it. That's not to say that you should not listen to or
accept criticism of the constructive type that comes from your contemporaries or your audience
but you should be sure to mediate and contextualize that criticism since if you try to cater for
everyone within a domain you'll end up with something derivative that fails to please anyone.
Protect your voice but listen for signals within the noise for how to let more of your voice shine.
Of course pleasing people isn't the only goal of creation. Some people produce art specifically to
annoy certain groups and sometimes all people. It's the case of many artists that the only disappointing
response to their work is indifference. If someone despises your work then you've had a serious impact
in their world. You've got them emoting. You've got them thinking and talking about you. You're
creeping around in their head leaving grimy footprints and handprints everywhere. Some artists
exist specifically to do this. Some are just douchebags. So even if thus far you've found very
few people out there that like your work if you like it then there will be others that do too.
They might be hard to find but at least with modern technology it's possible.
I'll talk another day about how this is actually getting harder again but there could be a huge
audience out there for your work. You just haven't stumbled across them yet. I know I certainly
haven't and don't think that because you haven't found your audience yet that this means your work
is unlovable. You presumably haven't shown it to everyone in the world so you don't know that.
And maybe your style isn't fashionable now but just as existing styles fall out of fashion
others become trendy. This is as true of art as it is with fashion. You may choose to tweak your
approach to better adhere with current trends but don't risk compromising your voice trying to keep
up with the Joneses. My wretchedly hopeful mantra these days is just keep turning up. It's a bit
like the whole build it and they will come thing. I think that if I just keep pushing my working
people's faces they'll eventually take pity on me and buy something or maybe I'm just ahead of my
time. I guess we'll find out. So although your job as an artist is to own your voice that doesn't
mean you can't tailor your output for the broadest possible audience. It's perhaps a slightly slippery
slope if you let this go too far and get caught in a commercial rut especially if you find some
success. But ultimately if you like producing work that's more commercial and it honors your
voice as much as the non-commercial work then good for you. Fill your boots. What many creators do is
try to get the best of both worlds. Produce both commercial work and personal work. This works well
as long as you can balance competing time pressures and that your commercial work can pay the bills.
This is a dilemma and trade-off that many that rely on art as their income have to face and it
can be a heartbreaking one. If like me you view your art primarily as a therapeutic outlet it's
especially tricky. I need money but I also need my mental health if I'm going to make money. Perhaps
I could make more money if I sacrifice my creative freedom but would I also be sacrificing some of the
therapeutic value? I'll come back to the joys of making money from art or not another day but it's
hard to talk about voice without mentioning it since it has a disproportionate effect on it.
It's just something you have to deal with if you choose to take your craft that far.
So in summary as an artist or as a creator your job is to find your voice and it's important
for you and your well-being and progression and satisfaction as a creator but it's also essential
from an outward facing perspective for you to differentiate yourself. Now for some tips on
finding your voice. First you've got to set aside time just to create as mindfully as possible and
to follow your nose as it were and work on things that you want to work on from day one.
Second spend some time bathing in your influences and try and figure out what it is about them that
really draws you to them. What is the essence of their voice? When trying to emulate and honour
them how does your own voice channel theirs? Third try not to judge yourself too harshly and
recognise when you're judging yourself by someone else's standards. Figure out where your own
standards lie and what good looks like for you. If it feels right it probably is right.
Fourth understand where your core capabilities your strength and weaknesses lie. Work with the
tools that you've got physical, psychological, economic, environmental. If you find that you
struggle to emulate someone else's craft find your own way to the same ends. These boundaries are not
weaknesses or limitations just resistance skills meander like rivers do. Fifth find beauty in your
own work by trusting yourself let your voice emerge by getting out of its way. Finding your
voice is as much about blocking other people's voices it's as much about not listening to
critics of not judging yourself by yardsticks of culture or society and to trust your own instincts
and to trust that your work will connect with people and if you can do that all the while
keeping your sanity then you'll be a force to be reckoned with but one way or another your voice
will only come when you stop shutting it down and just let it flow. I'll leave you with some words
from some folks that are much more articulate and erudite than me. In their book Art and Fear, one of
my favorite books on the practice of art, David Bale and Ted Orland explore the inner world of the
artist and tackle many of the issues both philosophical and practical that I touch upon
in this episode and many others. It's a book that I will most likely return to again. Here's what
they had to say on the subject of voice. The artistic evidence for the constancy of interior
issues is everywhere. It shows in the way most artists return to the same two or three stories
again and again. It shows in the palette of Van Gogh the characters of Hemingway the orchestration
of your favorite composer. We tell the stories that we have to tell stories of the things that
draw us in and why should any of us have more than a handful of those? The only work really worth
doing the only work that you can do convincingly is the work that focuses on the things you care
about. To not focus on those issues is to deny the constants in your life. Thanks again for
