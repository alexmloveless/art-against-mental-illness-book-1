# Episode 5: Space - Significant Quotes

## Opening Metaphor
> "So I heard a story about a guy called Jack. Jack sujournes for the winter to act as a caretaker for a remote hotel in Colorado. He did this to relieve his writer's block, which he kind of achieved since he ends up having a breakdown and attempting to axe murder his family. Okay, so that's clearly the plot of The Shining, but it helps set the scene for the conversation I want to have around finding space in your life to be creative."

## Core Premise
> "For the value of art and creativity to be truly transformative, you have to find some space in your life that is permanent, that is hardwired into your daily or weekly existence."

> "You need to find some time and space to express yourself that's free of responsibilities, distractions and all the stressful hubbub of the daily grind. I do not consider this an optional part of the art therapy journey."

## Permission and Impunity
> "At the very least you need to try and bring some portion of yourself and give that portion of yourself the permission to engage in the creative act with impunity and without obstruction."

## Living Situations
> "Perhaps you live in the house of a bunch of drunk students or you have young kids, although there's not a lot of difference between those two."

## Monotropic Focus
> "Well strictly speaking it's not, but the creative act in the way that I talk about it is a solitary process, a monotropic process. What do I mean by that? I mean that you need to give enough of your being to it, your attention, your body."

## Music and Concentration
> "When I'm painting I can listen to a podcast or an audiobook, but if I'm writing I can't listen to anything where I can discern the words, otherwise I just can't concentrate. No words of mine will come."

> "Any songs with clearly audible lyrics, particularly hip-hop, I just can't screen them out so I tend to listen to a lot of death metal because you can't usually hear what they're saying and probably don't want to anyway."

## Flow States
> "If someone disturbs you while you're in one of these states, not only is it annoying, it's a bit like knocking a train off its tracks. It can't continue and it's going to take a bunch of heavy lifting to get it back on its tracks before it can even get moving again."

> "From a therapeutic perspective, flow states are like gold dust."

## Productivity vs. Therapy
> "Being productive is not a necessary prerequisite to being a happy creative and frequently has an entirely negating effect on the therapeutic value of art."

> "It's about how much is lost in that little disturbance in terms of the calming power of the creative act."

## Modern Life Pressures
> "It seems in the modern world, in the west at least, you're always supposed to be doing something. Every moment must be lived to the max."

> "It's generally believed that those in hunter-gatherer tribes, both of antiquity and existing remote tribes, only tend to work for three or four hours a day. The rest of the time is spent chilling."

## True Rest
> "Humans need respite. Not ten minutes snatched while the toddler tries to hospitalise themselves in the back garden. Not that faintly uncomfortable date with your other half. Not time in front of the TV, only half paying attention while you doom scroll and answer snapchats. All of that is a different flavoured version of the same slog."

> "No, humans need rest. True rest. And failure to get this will inevitably result in decline in mental health."

## Guilt and Permission
> "I think people feel more guilty in front of an easel than they would in front of the TV."

> "How often are you only half there, feeling like you should be somewhere else, doing something else? But the kids aren't stopping you. You are."

## Scheduling Creative Time
> "If you're serious about building art into your life, then you need to be more purposeful about this. It's best to create some time in your schedule, preferably at the same time every day, or whichever days of the week make sense, and book these out."

> "That time must be sacrosanct and respected, especially by you."

## Personal Example
> "I have the hours between 6pm and 8pm, at least 5 out of 7 days a week blocked out for this. I'm often very wound up and stressed from my day job, and this is how I wind down."

> "My family knows what happens when I can't get this time. I don't just get grumpy and petulant. This is not I must have my man time. If I don't make this space in my schedule, I simply stop functioning."

> "This time for me is all but prescribed. And it's considerably more effective than either therapy or medication, and believe me I know, having been prescribed both multiple times."

## Process Over Product
> "It's important to remember that what you produce in that time is only peripherally important. Back from my mantra like obsession with process, see episode 2, what you do, the quality of that time matters way more than what you produce or how productive or effective you are."

> "Quality time spent doing something you love is worth way more than anything you might make anyway."

## Homework Assignment
> "So to your homework, I want you to find that regular headspace. I want you to go look at your routine, your calendar or whatever, and I want you to carve out some time to make that creative space."

> "No ifs, no buts, no guilt, no disturbance."
