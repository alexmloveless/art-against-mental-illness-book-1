# Episode 33: Learning How to Learn
## Episode Summary

**Recording Date:** February 9, 2025  
**Episode Length:** ~32 minutes  
**Location:** Alex's studio in Scotland

### Core Theme
This episode explores the critical importance of understanding your own learning style when approaching creative endeavors. Alex argues that recognizing how you personally learn is essential for successfully acquiring new skills and maintaining mental health through creative practice.

### Key Arguments

**Autodidactic Learning vs. Traditional Education**
Alex identifies as an autodidact—someone who teaches themselves—and contrasts this with traditional educational approaches. He argues that standard schooling caters to the "center of the bell curve" but doesn't work for everyone, particularly those with ADHD, autism, or pathological demand avoidance (PDA).

**Personal Learning Style Discovery**
Through his own educational journey, Alex discovered he learns best through:
- Skimming introductory material to understand scope
- Diving immediately into practical application
- Learning through making mistakes and hitting barriers
- Utilizing hyperfocus periods for intensive learning
- Rejecting being told what to do in favor of self-directed exploration

**The Importance of Self-Knowledge**
Alex emphasizes that understanding your learning style is crucial because trying to learn in a way that doesn't suit you leads to:
- Lack of pleasure and enjoyment
- Increased stress and frustration
- Taking longer to acquire skills
- Potential abandonment of new pursuits

### Practical Applications

**Strategic Approach to New Skills**
- Start with cheaper materials to experiment
- Lower barriers to entry
- Plan your approach based on your learning style
- Accept that some subjects require safety considerations (electrician work, flying)

**Embracing Failure as Learning**
- Accept that failure is natural and necessary
- Don't be overly self-critical, especially early on
- Understand that hitting barriers indicates boundaries, not inability
- Use failure to know when to seek advice or try different approaches

**Non-Linear Learning Process**
- Learning comes in fits and starts
- Progress isn't always linear—you might get worse before getting better
- Breakthrough moments often result from multiple factors aligning
- Be patient with the natural ebb and flow of skill development

### Mental Health Connection

Alex directly connects learning approach to mental health, arguing that:
- Self-created barriers are often the biggest obstacles to progress
- Understanding how you learn reduces frustration and stress
- Creative pursuits can only benefit mental health if they're accessible and enjoyable
- The wrong learning approach can make beneficial activities feel impossible

### Personal Examples
- **Wood carving:** Current learning project using his self-directed approach
- **Programming:** Career built through autodidactic learning methods
- **Guitar playing:** Contrast between struggling with traditional instruction vs. success with improvisation and experimentation
- **Art:** Seven years of self-taught creative practice

The episode reinforces Alex's core thesis that creativity serves mental health best when approached in ways that align with individual learning styles and preferences.
