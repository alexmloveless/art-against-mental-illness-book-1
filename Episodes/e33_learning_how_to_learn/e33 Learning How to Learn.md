*   The episode focuses on learning, particularly in creative endeavors, and its connection to mental health.
*   Alex identifies as an autodidact, someone who teaches themselves, and emphasizes the importance of understanding one's own learning style.
*   Traditional schooling often caters to an average learning style, which may not suit everyone, especially those with ADHD, autism, or pathological demand avoidance (PDA).
*   Alex shares his personal experience of struggling in school due to his learning style and eventually excelling when he discovered how he learns best.
*   His method involves skimming introductory material, diving into practical application, learning by making mistakes, and utilizing hyperfocus.
*   He contrasts his learning style with those who need explicit instructions and a structured approach, highlighting the spectrum of learning preferences.
*   The episode stresses the importance of understanding how you learn to avoid frustration and potential abandonment of new skills.
*   It advises starting with cheaper materials to experiment and strategize before investing heavily in a new skill.
*   Accepting failure is crucial for learning, as it helps identify boundaries and when to seek advice.
*   Learning is not linear and can involve setbacks, but persistence and adapting one's approach are key.
*   External barriers and personal limitations exist, but often self-created barriers are the biggest obstacles to progress.
*   Overcoming these barriers involves reevaluating one's approach and attacking the challenge with renewed vigor.


**Alex:** [00:00:00] Hello again, welcome to my studio in sunny Scotland. , it's, it's freezing cold in here and, , the room is, is dusty as hell, but I wanted to, , do this episode from here because this is the place where I do most of my learning and this episode is about learning.

And, so if you hear some noise in the background, I'm guessing there's going to be car sounds and there will be voices and various other things. It's because I'm in my studio and there's very, very little noise. Barrier between me and the outside world. Uh, this place has almost no installation at all So, uh, it's always cold and it's always noisy if it's noisy outside and I hope you'll bear with me if you're on audio only if you prefer, I've recorded this as a video as well, so you can tune in and see my lovely face talking at you for the next, uh, however long, , that can be found on YouTube.

I'll put the, , the link in the show notes. But yes, hello, and so here I am and I'm going to talk about [00:01:00] learning. Why am I going to talk about learning? Well, because this is a podcast about art and mental health and and there's always a trajectory between a particular hobby or pastime or creative activity and and then becoming proficient enough at that that you can really use it to benefit yourself either from a mental health perspective or from a financial perspective or whatever.

and I'm actually in the process of, of learning a new skill at the moment. This is not particularly unusual for me. Uh, I've been experimenting for some weeks now with wood carving. Just before Christmas, I bought myself a rotary tool, which is this thing here, uh, with the end there. Uh, and for those who are just listening, it's, uh, it's like a small orange drill thing with a little power tool with a long extension on it that has a, uh, a drill bit on the end. And this is used for, , carving or [00:02:00] engraving or etching, , Into words or metal or stone or whatever. And, uh, it's really good for, , making patterns in words or carving word to a particular form.

And, uh, I, I bought this on a whim and I've since been teaching myself how to, , How to carve wood and what all the difficulties are with it and Bits to use to do what job and I'm teaching this largely to myself and this is what got me thinking about Learning because I'm what you call an autodidact or autodidact Which is a really simple word for I?

someone who teaches themselves. Now I always thought this was a bit of a ridiculous word because , I've always been that way. I've always been the sort of person that learns on my own steam, on my own time, my own way. And, and I just assumed everyone else was the same way. But it turns out that really isn't the case.

People have very many different ways of learning different styles of [00:03:00] learning. Some people like me have a strong preference. for self learning. Some people need very, very explicit instructions before they'll try anything. And some people sit in between. And I think it's really important to understand how you learn because especially if you're going to start something new, understanding how It is that you learn how what your particular learning style is will be instrumental in and probably absolutely critical in your ability to learn anything new.

For the purposes of this episode, I'll be focusing on, , creative endeavors. Uh, but honestly, this same set of stuff should apply to anything. You feel like you need to learn, be a, a programming language, a foreign language, um, accounting, electricianry, whatever. , with some caveats, obviously, which I'll come to, , when we get to them. But, , I think a lot of people. think they know how to learn, , but have learned. [00:04:00] Someone else's method for learning. And so when we are at school, certainly in the UK, but I think pretty much everywhere, there is a certain style of, of learning, , and teaching, , that Kate is very much for the.

the broader array of students, the center of the bell curve, if you will, the, the, the style of teaching that's going to reach the maximum number of students in terms of how they need to learn pretty much the average way of learning. Now, I'm painfully aware that there are deficiencies in this view, particularly in the UK, that the standard way of teaching and learning is the optimal way for the maximum number of students, or even any of the students.

But I'm going to put that debate aside really because I don't know enough about it. But strictly speaking, I couldn't agree more, but it's perhaps for podcast. Let's just assume that the predominant form of learning is broadly, , the best way for most students, [00:05:00] and that's effectively, turning up to a building where, uh, someone with some level of expertise on some subject stands in front of you, guides you through the principles and the various subject areas of any given, discipline and sets you exercises and homework and, and then tests you on it. that if you take me as an example, that's, that's almost completely anathema to me in terms of learning. Um, there's a reason why I, I, I'm an autodidact. Partly because I, I simply can't be taught. I'm ADHD. I'm autistic. And sitting me down in front of someone talking at me, uh, is, is going to be very, very counterproductive.

I simply can't pay attention. My mind constantly wanders and I, I get bored and irritable and, and it really bothers me. really affects my mental health quite badly. So that that's the [00:06:00] first thing. And the second thing is the dreaded PDA, the pathological demand avoidance. And this is something that I only really realized about myself quite recently, uh, is that I, I can't be told what to do.

I don't want to be like this. I didn't choose to be like this. I don't know why I'm like this, but when someone tells me to do something, regardless of how much I already want to do it or not, as the case may be, I immediately don't want to do it on being told that I need to or have to. And, and it's made my life Quite difficult for my whole life and I've got various coping strategies.

For example, if someone tells me to do something, I will, I will change that task just enough to make it feel like I decided to do the task. It was my task that I was doing, and therefore I can do the thing that the person wanted me to do or asked me to like my boss or someone, um, and, uh, and yet still maintain my sanity and not lose my [00:07:00] shit.

And so. We've got this double whammy is I can't pay attention and I, and I can't be told what to do. And so school for me was brutally difficult and I, I was in the remedial classes for most of my school life. I was, Uh, put in in classes where they took us aside and gave us much easier things to do.

They thought that I was learning impaired. , they took me for all sorts of tests, including eyesight, but never funny enough, autism and ADHD in the UK wasn't really a thing. This is, uh, in the, early eighties onwards. And, and so I was sort of sitting around Not really doing much, wondering why all these other kids were in, like, history classes and so on.

And we were drawing pictures and reading really, really simple books for, students much younger than us. And, and I didn't really understand it, but I also didn't really care. It didn't seem to me like what everyone else was doing was [00:08:00] particularly interesting, , or fun. And what we were doing was fun.

And it wasn't until right into secondary school when I was like 13, 14, 15 that I realized at some point um after being heavily bullied um and disappearing and trying to blend into the into the background so that no one noticed me and decided to make my life difficult.

I realized that I wasn't stupid. I realized that actually, uh, some of the, the subjects or the disciplines or the skills that some of the other kids around me who were considered smart had, I just found easy. And, and so what happened was, in the space of two years, I went from, for example, the bottom maths group to the maths group.

, I was never gonna compete with the, the best mathematicians there because I'd lost so much time and I was playing catch up. But broadly, what had happened there is, one, I was deliberately trying to [00:09:00] disappear, blend into the background and not be noticed. So I just got my head down and did things and tried to sort of pay attention and learn things.

And, at that point in schooling coursework was a big thing in the UK. And so a lot of the time, The learning and the outputs were self directed and allowed us to sort of choose the projects that we did and and how we went about doing them. And for me, that was perfect.

So I just got on with it. And I really excelled in maths and science and various other things, including art and, and everyone was a bit surprised, like how, how did this kid go off and, you know, either sell, assaulted the devil or get some sort of magic intelligence injection. And bear in mind, I'm pretty certain I'm, , dyslexic as well. I'm, an August baby, which meant I was the youngest in the year. A DHD autistic heavily bullied. It was little wonder that I, I didn't excel, uh, I was. in a year group where everyone else was effectively older than me and most of them, , much older [00:10:00] than me and, and I was, I would struggle with everything.

Everything was taxing for me and so eventually I figured out I wasn't stupid and, and leaving school was a huge thing for me. But it wasn't until a bit later that I realized also that what else had changed is that I'd understood how I needed to learn things and this was a bit of an epiphany for me. I could just go and learn things. And we had these things called libraries. And, you know, this was before the internet was really much of a thing. And, , I just, I just went and started hoovering up information and figuring out what it was that I liked and what I was good at.

Eventually. God knows how I found myself in IT, uh, and eventually being a sort of programmer, analyst, data scientist, all these things, all of which I taught to myself. And, and I, developed a, , a method for learning, , which was along the lines of, , say I wanted to learn a new programming language.

Well, I would go by the book on it, learn [00:11:00] Python, learn or something. I would skim through the the introductions of each chapter to familiarize myself with the things that they thought I needed to learn and then I would simply start developing making code and and this is the only way I found that I could learn I would start doing things but well how do I do this then and I'd try and do it and it wouldn't work and I would go I know I can do this because I saw it in the you So I go jump into chapter six and say, well, how do I do this?

And then I would just get on with it. And I fundamentally learned by making mistakes. I learned by hitting barriers I kind of need to make mistakes.

I can't be told to do things. If you tell me that the right way of doing something is the way I have to do it, I'll deliberately not do that until I figure out for myself why that way is the right way. So I make a lot of mistakes, but, uh, I tend to make them quite quickly. What comes with ADHD is hyperfocus, which is the ability and the compulsion to focus on one thing that captures my interest, [00:12:00] for, for long periods of time and, and work on it absolutely frenetically.

So I, I start hoovering up information, uh, And work really quickly and make mistakes really quickly, , to coin a phrase that's now starting to have real negative connotations . I would move fast and break things, , or fuck around and find out. You can do that when you're learning a programming language or a new artistic skill.

Uh, doing it to the American economy and the American society is probably less advised, but well, we're all going to find out whether or not that works in the very near future. Anyway, I, I sort of started to apply this approach to anywhere I could. And when I started doing art again, um, about seven years ago, it was obvious art and creativity is the obvious way to apply this type of, of learning, because if you want to paint a picture.

get a canvas and start painting, right? And I, you know, I, I learned things by going, well, that didn't work. [00:13:00] What did I do wrong? Let's try and figure out what I did wrong. If I could figure it out, I would, I would fix it. If I couldn't figure it out, then I've got the internet these days. I've got books, I can ask for advice.

And, and so that's how I learned. And, and I didn't realize until, , relatively recently that that that was called being autodidact and apparently that was a thing and I was one of them fine i'll take that it is what it is. , but why isn't everyone else that way so i've met plenty of people who Need to have a certain structure around them to be able to learn that cannot or do not feel like they have permission to move forward on a subject until they've, been told by someone how to do it and given permission to start doing it.

So these are the sort of people that fare a lot better in school and some people are quite extreme on this front in that they simply are almost frozen until someone tells them [00:14:00] specifically, explicitly what to do, gives them permission to do it and explains to them all the risks and the benefits and blah, blah, blah.

So they, , wouldn't decide to write a short story and then just start writing it. They would go off and research writing short stories for quite a while before even setting a single word down. And, that's crazy to me. I don't know why you would do that.

But then people who are like that tend to look at me going, how'd you, why'd you just dive in? That's mental. That's just completely crazy. but I can't learn their way and they can't learn my way. We're just not wired like that. And so there, there are spectrums in between there and they're all sorts of learning styles that may or may not align with neuro type that suits certain people and that suits certain lifestyles.

And for example, , if you're very time poor. You probably don't have the luxury to, , take the very considered, very slow and methodical [00:15:00] uptake of a new skill. And especially in things like professional situations, you're gonna get thrown in the deep end. And, and, and you'll see that, in that environment, a lot of the people that, that the ones that are most successful are the ones that can, react and learn on the fly.

when, when given new and difficult situations, that's not necessarily the best thing and doesn't necessarily result in the best people being promoted. But this is the world that we live in. Anyway, my point here is, um, the, when you're starting something new, it's really worth stepping back and taking a little bit of time to think about how, how it is that you learn.

Um, And how it is that you're going to, to learn this new skill based on that. You're going to learn how to, uh, write short stories and that, there's probably a somewhat linear approach to this. I've done this myself, [00:16:00] whereby you sort of understand. structure plot, uh, you refresh your understanding of English grammar or language usage, you try and increase your lexicon size and you go out and you try and Stimulate yourself to come up with ideas if you haven't already got them.

Maybe you'll join a writing group, uh, maybe you'll, you'll take a class and get instruction and, and then follow a sort of linear path set out by a particular course or a particular instructor. and quite honestly, the whole learning economy is set up to support that type of learning.

And if you're like that, then good for you, uh, you probably just want to take the, the normal path. But if you're like me or, or has a, have a completely different learning style to me even, then you probably need to think a bit differently about taking up a new subject. Now, you can't always, you know, Like I did with the the wood carving [00:17:00] just plow in There are certain things like for example, you decided you wanted to be an electrician.

I Definitely do not advise going and fiddling around with some of your electrical cables and Wiring in your house to see what works and see what doesn't because you'll probably find pretty quickly None of it works because you're going to electrocute yourself and you're going to die Right. So there are obviously caveats to this where you do need to take some prior learning the same rule still applies here.

Uh, and, uh, and I think you still need to figure out the right approach for you doing that and maybe researching, , training or educational paths for that particular area. Uh, is, is wise and seeing which ones are most appropriate to you, but I'm going to assume that you are smart enough not to, um, decide that you want to fly a plane, , without an instructor.

or. [00:18:00] Go skydiving without an instructor. These are not, not clever things to do, but if you want to start lino cut or painting or writing or drawing or performance or any of these things, there's an element to which you can just get stuck in and just have a go. And, and then from there, what is your strategy?

What happens when you, you hit a barrier. What do you do? Uh, how do you problem solve? How do you usually go about these things? So think back on projects that you've done before and think to yourself, well, I had to learn this thing and I had to learn it quite quickly. How did I do that? Well, I did think A, B and C.

Now maybe that particular, , learning experience wasn't representative of what you're trying to learn now, but there's, there's a thread that runs through the way that our behaviors are and the way that we [00:19:00] learn. And you will find similarities and maybe the best thing is to hunt for your memory for something that you did that was a little bit more appropriate to the current task.

But either way, you're going to find methodologies, heuristics, behaviors, , and, and various things that help you to understand how it is that you learn. as I said, I'm no stranger to learning. I'm always learning something new.

It's a bit of an ADHD thing. I get such a buzz and a high out of learning new things. There's almost a certain melancholy to it because I tend to realize that I don't stick with anything for that long. And, I'm way into woodcarving now, but it's just as likely in six month time, I'll suddenly have decided I'm going to, um, sculpt, , sea life with with, uh, dried cow dung or something.

And some of these skills might transfer or I might just be on a completely different kick. Uh, and, and [00:20:00] that's fine. I get it. I wish I was a bit better at following through on things. , and if you'd listened to my last episode, on, the beauty in repetition, you'll hear me talking about some of this, but I can't change who I am.

And I've tried to learn things many, many times. I, for example, I play the guitar. I'm, I'm not very good at it. I've been playing since I was, I guess, 12 or 13. So like a long time. I learned initially with my friend Jason in his bedroom, we were trying to play, the music of our shared , guitar heroes.

And at that point I was quite into my virtuoso guitarist. So these are like the hardest people to try and copy. Joe Saptiani, Steve Vai, people like that, the real, shredders of the late eighties and early nineties. Jason is, uh, an incredibly gifted. And I say that very advisedly because I've said here before , and [00:21:00] I'll say a lot in the future.

There's no such thing as talent. You might be born with the aptitude to do something, , versus someone else, , who has less aptitude or less ability or less physical ability or less psychological, emotional, or, uh, intellectual ability. But one way or the other, learning how to do something like playing the guitar takes a lot of effort.

And some people say, Oh, you're really talented as if that means that you just sort of picked up a guitar and you can whittle away, um, a thousand notes a minute. And, uh, Oh, well that was all very easy cause you're gifted. Um, no, Jason has the right mind for it. He's got the right, , mentality, the right emotional makeup.

He just found learning the guitar a lot easier than me, and I found it really, really, really brutally hard. And to see him progress as we grew up, it was quite daunting, but he would always try and help me, he would try and teach me, and I think I was a very difficult student. .

So [00:22:00] let's learn how to play this. Let's learn how to play that. And I, and I, I really couldn't do it. I found it really, really hard, I don't read music, but we had what was called tablature, which is effectively it sits above the music stave and tells you, , , which, , strings to press on which fret on the guitar.

Anyone can read it that understands the basics of playing guitar. but even then I just couldn't focus in. , the, the numbers would sort of swim around the page and I, I couldn't remember the thing that was supposed to hit between looking at the page and looking at the guitar and where I was putting my fingers.

And I found it would cause me immense amounts of stress and difficulty and Headaches and all sorts of things simply trying to learn something that someone else played no, I don't have the type of air that means I can hear what they've said and And then just play it other than the most basic things Jason went off, he's in bands, he does performance.

He, [00:23:00] he, uh, he does singing. He was on tv. He's great. He does that. That's his thing. And he's still an incredible guitarist. But for me, , what I learned is that I just really can't, and I don't really want to learn other people's stuff. It's just too laborious for me. So I taught myself how to improvise and, um, and, and, and that's what I do.

I improvise. I pick up the guitar. Plug it into, , an amp, , plug in one or other of my, , effects pedals and, and just wang around making a great sound. God awful noise. And I'm not great. I probably don't sound great, but I have so much fun doing it and I've got much better. I've progressed in my style and my ability and via that I learned a lot of the theory that I've been missing because I find it boring or too abstract or whatever.

Again, I'm not great on music theory. I'm not a great guitarist, but I understand way more than you do. Now than I did before and it all came about because I learned how to play the guitar via just doing it. Like just plugging in and seeing what [00:24:00] happened when I did this or did that and you know smash the strings like here or plugged in this uh really gnarly distortion pedal and turned it all up to number 11.

I just loved it and and one of my favorite things to do funnily enough is just to create feedback. So I've got a few pedals that are really And I can just create feedback with my little Vox speaker and to everyone else that's horrible noise, but I found electric guitar feedback beguiling, like beautiful, like uh, uh, uh, ephemeral, keening beauty 

Why is learning how to learn so important for taking up or progressing in any creative endeavor? We'll put simply, if you're trying to learn in a way that doesn't suit you, it's not going to be pleasurable. It's not going to be fun.

It's going to be stressful. It's going to take longer. And maybe you just give up. Maybe you think this is not fun. for me, this is not my medium. I can't do [00:25:00] this when the reality is almost certainly you can. And that's the reason you are failing at learning it is because you're trying to learn the wrong way.

and that makes me sad that people are giving up things because they feel more difficult than in reality they are. And that's, And some of the biggest leaps I've made have simply been stopped trying to do things how I'm being told to do them by the mainstream education and, and to figure out and sit down and figure out what my way of learning this needs to be.

And for me, I even love the task of figuring out how I'm going to learn something because Yes, you can't just dive in. It can be wasteful. If, if what you want to do is learn how to carve really expensive woods, , well, you're going to have to start on cheap woods. Don't just dive straight in and buy, , a 500 quid slab of, absolutely gorgeous hundreds of [00:26:00] years old wood.

Cause you're going to destroy it. You need to strategize and say, well, right, let's find some words that's, um, that's cheap but of a similar, say, consistency or colour or whatever, um, let's go and buy some cheap canvases and just slop around. Let's buy a cheap guitar, let's buy a cheap violin, just good enough to do what you want and start fucking around.

Lowering those barriers to entry is a really big starting point. Maybe that's not the best way for you to do it. You need to think about it. And, and I like to think about how I'm best going to learn something. I find it really positive and stimulating and exciting to think through well, here's what I understand about this thing that I'm going to do.

I, I rarely try and start something about some knowledge, otherwise why would you start it? Um, but I, I think to myself, how am I going to learn this? Where do I start? Where is best for me? How can I do this without creating havoc, [00:27:00] mess, spending lots of money, uh, annoying everyone around me and so on.

And I'll put in a little bit of thought and planning at the beginning, just simply. So when I start, I'm kind of as best near I can to being, , frictionless. And then the next thing you have to do is accept failure. And this is arguably the most important part of any learning endeavour

it's, it's really important that you are not too critical and, uh, especially in the early stages. When you hit a barrier, that's natural. When you don't know how to do something, it's natural. When you can't make your fingers form that chord, that's natural. You will be able to, you just have to keep pushing on.

Don't let it get you down. Don't be too self critical and, and just keep pushing on. And if you can't do that thing, leave it for a bit. Go away, try something else. Try some different exercises. And try and [00:28:00] find some way to loosen yourself up so you are able to come back and try that thing again. And then you'll almost certainly figure it out.

And don't beat yourself up over failures. It's really, really bad to do that. And when you think about it, when you first start driving a car, you can't expect to get in there and some jukes of hazard, A team style jumping over bridges and stuff. You have to Jesus, I'm showing my age there.

You need, you know, you need to understand some basics. You need to start slowly. You need to understand that you're going to stall every now and again. You need to not get yourself too worked up and try and relax. And, uh, And once you've sort of got those two things, how am I going to learn this and this mentality of failing and just remember how important failing is because that's how you understand where your boundaries are and also how you know when to go and ask for advice or to [00:29:00] go and study some more or to try different things because you've got something wrong.

There's very, very few people, if any, It up and you endeavor and just sort of intuited their way through it without making any mistakes. When you learn, it comes in fits and starts that are based on simple, Physics to your energy levels to your emotional state to your life circumstances to Your ability to find time and to make sure you've got the right headspace to to practice something Um, this is all natural and normal So the the learning process is is not linear and in fact, it might roll backwards You might actually get worse at things before you get better.

For example, if you've, if you've, uh, trained yourself to do things in a certain way and you figure out that way is really not optimal, it can be quite difficult to train yourself out of that, but it's worth doing. But in the meantime, you're going to [00:30:00] find that you, you, you, you get worse and, and you just have to accept that.

And I think that's another really important acknowledgement that you won't learn linearly? And how many times have you, been learning something and there's this been this one thing you couldn't do. You and it was really bugging you.

And then one day you'd get in front of your views or you pick up your instrument and then you just do it. You're like, wow, I could do that. What happened? You know, I must've gone to sleep last night and had some amazing epiphany, but it's of course, it's never like that. It was linear when you're, when you think about it, but that was the first time you, you came to your, , your practice and all the right things coalesce.

You're in a right state of mind. You had the time, you were relaxed. You weren't worrying about it. The way you set up your instrument or your easels or a new brush you've been using, uh, or just not being tired or, or, or not being irritable.

And suddenly you can do this. And, and it was a, it was a whole, um, collection [00:31:00] of, of circumstances that have led you to be able to, to now do that thing that you couldn't do before.

So that's, I think all I'm going to say about learning. This definitely won't be the last time this comes up. it's one of the most critical and central things to my core thesis on, uh, the value of art to mental health.

And my belief that, One of the biggest barriers to us really using creativity to maintain our mental health is the barriers we put up for ourselves. The problems that we cause for ourselves that stop us from progressing. And yes, there are always external factors. Yes, there might be things that you simply aren't configured to do.

Um, But ultimately most things you can do if you think you can do it, if there's no obvious impediment, then you almost certainly can. Um, and when, when it comes down to it, if you're failing at that, it's almost always because of barriers you've [00:32:00] created. So the positive side of that is that these are things that you can fix.

Um, it's a really great interview. , so I really look forward to sharing that probably sometime in the next week.

Otherwise, uh, enjoy yourself. And especially if you're in America, keep safe, and keep fighting the good fight. You matter. Bye!
