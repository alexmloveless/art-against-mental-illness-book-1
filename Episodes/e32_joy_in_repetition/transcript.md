> It seemed as if a thousand lights had been lit round them and she was dazzled by the brightness of them. Then very gently, as if he was afraid to frighten her, Lord Ravenscar put his arms round her and drew her close to him. For one moment he looked down at her face as her head fell back against his shoulder and then he drew her closer still and his lips were on hers. For a moment she could not believe it was happening. Then the love in her heart rose like a warm wave up through her throat and into her lips. She knew that this was what she had longed for, prayed and cried for, but thought would never happen because Lord Ravenscar was in love with someone else. It was perfect and together they were one with the beauty all round them and yet also a part of the sky, her prayers and all she believed was sacred. Lord Ravenscar kissed her until she felt as if he drew her heart from between her lips and made it his. 

> When at length he raised his head, she could only look up at him with her lips trembling and her eyes full with the glory of sunset. 

> “I love you,” he said a little unsteadily. “And now tell me, my darling, what you feel for me.” 

> “I love you! I love you!” Romara cried. “And I have done so since the first moment I saw you, although I did not know it was love.” 

That piece of uplifting romantic prose was taken from Lord Ravenscar's Revenge, which was written in 1978 by the queen of the pulp romance, Barbara Cartland.

The same year Cartland published 17 other books. That wasn't even her busiest year, which was 1976 when she published 23 books earning her the Guiness world record for the most books published in a single year. To say that Cartland was prolific is an understatement of a level that Barbs herself was likely incapable of.

For a while I've been a little obsessed by Cartland and her creative fecundity. There's something almost superhuman about it. It's hard not to draw parallels between her and Generative AI, but that's for another day. 23 books in a single year seems like an insane number for one person even _with_ the help of AI! It didn't seem plausible to me so I did some research. I had some questions. For example:

- Did she have help? Maybe ghost writers or the equivalent or studio assistants like Warhol and Da Vinci. The answer is yes, well sort of. Cartland often dictated her work to an assistant typist.
- Did she write essentially the same book over and over. Again, sort of, her works are somewhat formulaic, but cover a variety of topics and subjects and are set in different periods, although she mainly focussed on historical fiction.
- Did she steal from other people? Yet again, maybe a little bit. Rival romantic novelist Georgette Heyer alleged that Cartland had stolen characters, names and plot lines from several of her books although this never made it to court.

Overall though, it seems that Cartland had an insane work ethic and a dedication to her art that bordered on that pathological.

I'd decided a while ago that she would feature in one of my episodes, and I figured that that being the case, I should actually read some of her work.

Since I struggle quite a lot with reading, I went on the hunt for an audiobook. Given that she wrote so many, and I wanted to experience her work at its most average, I decided to pick one largely at random. This ended up being The Importance of Love, which I think I chose because it was available and had the sort of title I would have expected from a Cartland novel. It was 4 hours and 20 minutes long, which equates to a bit under 200 hundred pages, so not exactly an epic. I dived in.

Here's a synopsis:

> The Viscount Kennington never had a good relationship with his father, the Earl, but loved his grandparents. After a family scandal erupted with the death of his grandfather, the feud worsens, and he retreats to his inherited house in Devon. Meanwhile, orphan Luella Ridgeway, pursued by Frank Connolly who threatens to expose a secret from her past, unexpectedly shows up at the Viscount’s doorstep. The Viscount falls for Luella, and when her life is endangered by Connolly, he must save her and prove his love despite her past. Will the Viscount reconcile with his father?

This was a turn of the century period piece with general nods to the master of this genre: Jane Austen. As is clear from the the synopsis, it was mostly predictable and formulaic. The writing was plain and workmanlike, but perfectly serviceable. The characters cliche but believable and likeable, the heroine was strong and independent, despite the general air of princess-rescuing melodrama. All just fine. Adequate. As expected. No surprises. Except for one. I didn't hate it. It didn't rock my world either, but I expected to spend the whole experience wincingly, hatefully dull, sappy, mushy, unreadable nonsense. But I found it generally charming, easy reading, which was at times quite enjoyable. The ending descends into cheesy, saccarine happy-ever-after-drivel - sorry for the spoilers if you happen to have this on your reading list - but up until that point, it was decent. I liked it. 

Which was precisely the problem: I _liked_ it! What the hell was that all about? I almost exclusively read science fiction, with the odd horror or thriller thrown in for variety. I most definitely don't read period romance! Or any romance at all for that matter.

Now, I'm far from the stereotypical "manly" man who loves cars and football and would die of immediately, rage-filled embarrassment at the suggestion that he would so much as glance at a romance book. I have an almost pathologically open mind. if I like something I like it. I don't really care whether society deems that unacceptable.

But of all the things I thought I would not like, romance novels were near the top with country music and genital torture. 

But the fact that I actually quite enjoyed reading this book sparked a bit of an identity crisis on the scale of finding out that suddenly that I was adopted. It required some soul searching. Asking myself "am I actually secretly a fan of romance?". Have I lived a life of missing out on my one true passion?

To be clear, I neither immune to nor repelled by romance in culture. I like a happy ending and am always most satisfied when the right people find each other. But whole novels of the stuff? Give me a break!

I had to find out. So I embarked on an experiment. I decided to read more romance, to dip my wick as it were, into the sordid underbelly of romantic fictions. I tried, among others, Gillie Cooper, Jane Austen and Marian Keys, but none of these hit the mark, not least because they were so damn long! So although I found much to like, I didn't find myself absorbed and addicted. 

Maybe I just read the wrong stuff, but I concluded that I am not a secret romance fan. So what was it about the Cartland novel that I liked? After pondering it for a while, here's what I concluded.

Put simply, Cartland is good at her trade. The reason I enjoyed it was because she'd put all the things in place that were required for an optimist like me to come along for the ride. It was well structured, paced well, the plot did what a plot is supposed to do, 3 acts, set-up, confrontation and resolution. It didn't piss around with lengthy self-indulgent descriptive prose or big words to make it sound clever. No pointless and confusing subplots, mcguffins, digressions. So despite clearly to being indebted to Jane Austen, in all the ways that matters it was the complete opposite. 

I'm not bashing Austen either. She was a pioneer and probably a genius. I __love__ her use of language, but probably not for the reasons I'm supposed to. I find her ability to use the longest and most obtuse or obscure word to say even the simplest thing comedically funny. But it's not leisurely reading, especially if you're dyslexic and have slow auditory processing like me.

The Importance of Love is just simple to the point and does exactly what you would expect. And given her target audience, that's exactly how it should be. Being any other way would be completely ridiculous. Cartland's books have sold somewhere between three quarters of a million and _two billion_ copies and is one of the best selling authors in history. She must be doing something right.

It might not be fine art, but she hit the spot with a __lot__ of people, and time and time again over __seventy six years__. That's quite a skill. There were still 160 unpublished at the time of her death at the age of 99 in the year 2000. 

Cartland had a formula. She had a system, she had a routine. She knew her art, and she knew it well. And it made her a boatload of money. If it ain't broke.

She figured out what people wanted, and what she wanted to do, and just did it, compulsively.

In a way I wish I was like that. Sometimes anyway. I wish I could find a thing that I'm sick at and that made me some money, and just keep doing that and keep doing it well. Keep pleasing myself, and keep pleasing the punters.

And I don't mean that in a haughty or derisive way. I'm not saying "life would be so easy if I could just keep punping out drivel to the brainless masses". I'm in awe of Cartland. Maybe I don't agree with everything she did or said. I'm not exactly a fanboy after reading one novel. But taking her body of work as a whole, observing her skills and work ethic, it blows me away. 

I go on a lot, on this podcast, about pushing boudaries, breaking rules, experimenting, never standing still. But that's just a symptom of how I'm configured. I'm always restless. The habitual Jack of all Trades. I never get _really_ good at anything. My body of work is inconsistent and stylistically erratic. 

So as much as I believe art is about creating new things, new ideas, concepts, I also believe that this can be achieved just as validly, with hard work, consistency, skill, mastery, dedication. Maybe each work in Cartland's portfolio isn't a work of artistic genius, but across her career, she did something that no one else has every done. 

I'm saying that there can be beauty in repetition. Passion can be displayed by doing one thing, and doing it really well. 

Take Claude Monet. He painted 26 paintings of the same haystacks. Capturing them in different light. Capturing their inherent beauty and character as the environment change, but they endured. 

He painted 250 paintings of the waterlilies in his garden. Monet found subjects that exeplified his aims, and then studied them over and over. 

We think that we see the world around us, but we rarely take the time to look. Not properly. Everything has its own beauty if you take the time to observe it. Be it haystack or a high rise. In many ways, the things that don't change have the most to offer, the most interesting story to yield. A flower may be a gift to the senses, but it is fleeting, impermentnt. But a rock. A rock can endure for centuries. Changing only subtly. Providing a habitat for countless other species from mamals, to insects to lichen and moss. Some rocks were put there by humans millenia before. Some fell from the sky.

Rocks are awesome. You might say that they rock. Sorry.

If you go back and listen to my interview with Sharon Milton she talks of feeling compelled to paint the same picture over and over in an effort to perfect it. Just one picture. Sharon tends to bounce around between mediums and approaches, so she's not stuck in a rut. She's not someone who has no interest in pushing her own boundaries. The point that she makes is that at that point, it was her way of controlling her life, which felt somewhat out of control. If she could perfect one work at a time, she would have some control over _something_, and forget about all the rest of the crazy while doing so.

For large parts of their careers, Rothcko and Mondrian only depicted squares, rectangles or grids. Frida Kahlo painted herself over and over. 

But I'm not specifically talking about obsessing about the same object ad infinitum, that's pretty extreme. I'm just pointing out that there's value in doing one thing, and doing it really well. Too many work of art and culture are unleashed on the world half-cocked, unfinished, unpolished, poorly conceived. Some might say that the majority of cultural output falls into this category, although that's a bit harsh.

But think about the final series of Game of Thrones. The Star Wars prequels, and arguably the sequels too. The MCU is almost entirely pumping sub-par content.

Ask any metal fan their opinion on Celtic Frost's disasterous Cold Lake or Metallica's ill-advised Lou Reed collaboration Lulu. All these were highly respected performers.

Art galleries are strewn with lazy, self-indulgent, trend-enthralled tat selling for silly money to brighten someone's dining room. I suspect that much of this drivel is in the process of being superceded by AI generated, 3D printed faux-art that will probably sell for the same price.

And don't even get me started on ghost-written celebrity literature and self-help books!

I could probably do a whole 5000 episode series on bad art and culture, and maybe I should, but that's not what we're here for.

My point is that good artists make bad work. Bad artists make bad work. And mediocre artists who make mediocre, but consistent and generally desirable work are not only valid artiests, but for the most part are the ones winning the game, and in many cases will be happier for it.

Bob Ross, Jack Vetriano, Roger Corman's entire film portfolio - I'll definitely be returning to him at some point - AC/DC, perhaps controversially, Taylor Swift, Dan Brown, etc. etc.

All these people know their craft, industry, medium and audience. That's why you've heard of them. 

There's nothing wrong with making lots of money from your art if you can do so by doing something that you love, or at least enjoy, and are genuine and honest in doing so. 

I'll sidestep the fact that there are many truly vile people hugely enjoying making grotesque and objectively immoral content, or seeking to manuplate people to their detrimant and own agrandisement, and all the other horrors that can seem like the norm these days.

I'm talking to and about you lot, and I'm sure you're all stomach churningly virtuous and woke TO THE MAX.

ANd the thing about selling lots of stuff is, and infuriatingly so, that you need to be consistent, often to the point of uniformity. The mass audeince has fairly simple expectations and most just want what they expect, which is basically some variation on what they've seen before. THis doesn't just apply to established or legacy artists and performers. TO be taken seriously in basically every creative space, you need to be producing some variation of one of the existing  styles or movements. Doing otherwise will simply result in you being ignored. So much for originality!

Of course, there are many people for whom this is the natural course of action. Those who revel in and adore the mainstream, and so fit in quite nicely when they turn up with a barely distinguishable 
variant on the prevalent form.

This is not a cultureal dictat, but merely a statistical reality. There has to be a mainstream or middle ground, otherwise there would be no place for originality and divergent thinking. Just image a world where the finite number of cultural arenas were liked equally among the populace. You basically find our group and stick with it. When a teste group gets too big, some folks are jettisonned to another group that's lacking. Not only would this not be possible, it would lead to the end of all novelty and innovation. It would also resemble, or perhaps be, some flavour of totalitarian fascism. Look around you right now, and you'll likely notice signs of this creeping into political and social discourse. Be wary folks. 

It is, however, possible to constantly reinvent yourself or you style while remaining mainstream and commercial, or at leastr popular. Consider Hockney, Radiohead, Madonna and Prince in their haydays. Spielberg, Kubrick and Ridley Scott switched their shit up almost permemently. What these all have in common is the deication to quality, and a certian signature style that resonates regardless of the genre or style. A voice you might say. They also earned their success by doing their time producing more mainstream fair, or basically defined that mainstream in the first place. 

There are very few creators that have truly earned the permission from their audience to to basically whatever they want. 

And so we get to the paradox. If you want success, you need consistency of quality and style, but if, like me, consistency is not your strong point and attempting it is detrimental to the other benefits of the activity, you're doomed to obscurity and starvation and seething resentment. 

That said, there are always exceptions, as creatives that's what I think most of us strive to achieve. To be that unicorn that does something different yet still finds a significant audience. That's part of the game I think. It's our little drama, and without tension and striving, drama can't exist.
 
I'm not here to tell you to make good art. I'm here to encorage you to make _any_ art, with the proviso that it improves your mental health. If you make _amazing_ art, but doing so makes you miserable, then maybe you need to stop. If making truly horrible art floats your boat, then good for you! There's always an market, and quite frankly, it might be the biggest one. 

I don't think we should look down on or sneer at people blessed with the skills and temperament to deliver mainstream level consistency, even if it's hard not to envy their success. Like our friend Barbara, they likely worked, and continue to work just as hard. There is also a right place, right time aspect to this, since there is many a workhorse, mainstream appropriate creator that has never, and maybe never will, achieve commercial success, through no real thought of their own.

I recogniose that I've gone a bit light on the mastery aspect of this this subject, since practise makes perfect, most people, having slaved over one medium for decades, tend to be really quite adept at it. But I'm going do a spearate episode on the tension between mastery and creativity.

So, if you happen to be the type of person that does one thing really well, then godspeed you, go forth and multiply, fill your boots etc. I'm off to obsess about this week's new creative obsession of mash potato crustacean sculpting.

Thanks as always for listening. Since I don't have the ability to make consistent, mainstream art, I don't make a lot of many from my passion. That being the case, please consider supporting me and my podcast on Patreon for as little as 1 pound a month. Please also like, rate, review and share this podcast.

I'll be back soon with an episode on something. But since I'm so capricious and inconsistent, I don't know what yet, so you'll just have to tune in and find out.
