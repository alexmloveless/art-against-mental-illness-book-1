## Process and Technique

### Fluid Art Process

### Watercolor vs. Acrylic
> "I think uh watercolor is a little bit too delicate for my uh sensibilities and my general approach so I don't do a lot of it but I spend a fair amount of time trying to achieve the sort of same effects as you can get on watercolor with acrylic paints on canvases and sometimes I win sometimes I don't"
