## III. Creative Philosophy in Action
### A. Nature vs. Control
- "Nature's a better artist than I am"
- Struggle with intervention vs. letting go
- Decision-making in real-time creative process
- Accepting unexpected outcomes

### B. Experimentation and Learning
- Creating "chaos" for new discoveries
- Using failed attempts as learning opportunities
- Generating ideas through process
- AI/neural network comparison for ideation

## IV. Personal Creative Challenges
