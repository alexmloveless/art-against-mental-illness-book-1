## On AI Voice Mismatch

> "I don't use chat GPT or any other language model to write these episodes for me."

## On Personal Knowledge and AI Limitations

> "would it make the choices that I made? Would it, if I said to it, insert some examples in here, would it chose the examples that I chose? Because they're very much part of me, my brain, the things that I know, the knowledge that I have."

> "GPT doesn't know everything. It knows probably all the facts that I know, but it doesn't know which facts I know. It doesn't know which I'm likely to choose."

## On Tool Use Philosophy

> "I don't shy away from using tools to help me do what I want. But only if they're actually helping me achieve the same thing I would have done otherwise but faster."

## On Conviction and Meaning
