# Episode 16: Finding Your Voice Addendum - Summary

## Overview
This addendum to episode 15 offers an unfiltered look into Alex's creative process through a raw, unedited recording made while walking in Scottish woods. Alex directly addresses why he chooses not to use AI language models to write his podcast scripts, despite his professional work with such technology.

## Key Points

### The Creative Process Behind the Podcast
- Alex records thoughts while walking using his phone's headphone microphone
- He transcribes these recordings and edits them into episodes
- This episode represents an unedited raw recording, offering insight into his real-time thinking

### AI vs. Authentic Voice
- Alex has experimented with using ChatGPT and other language models to write episodes
- Despite his professional expertise with NLP and data science, he finds AI-generated content lacks his authentic voice
- AI tends to produce "corporate American" language that doesn't match his natural speaking style
- Even with detailed prompts and examples, AI misses crucial nuances and personal choices

### The Importance of Personal Discovery in Writing
- Writing process involves unexpected discoveries and research tangents
- Example: While researching artists for episode 15, Alex learned about Stephen Hawking, Yoko Ono, Lamont Young, Napalm Death
- Research led to deeper understanding of Middle East politics through Banksy's West Bank Wall work
- These discoveries enriched the content in ways AI couldn't replicate

### The Value of Authentic Voice
- Personal conviction comes from personally choosing words, examples, and structure
- The process itself is integral to the output - removing parts for convenience changes everything
- Alex's knowledge base and personal associations inform his artistic choices
- Authenticity matters more than efficiency in creative work

## Episode Context
- Recorded October 24, 2024, in central Scotland
- Meta-commentary on podcast production methods
