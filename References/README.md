# References Directory

This directory manages cross-references, bibliography, and indexing for the book.

## Contents

- Cross-reference tracking files
- Bibliography entries (including non-traditional sources like YouTube videos and podcasts)
- Index preparation materials
- Person/work reference database
- Glossary of terms and common mistranslations

The cross-reference system uses placeholder IDs (e.g., [REF:creativity-basics]) that are replaced with actual chapter numbers and titles during final compilation.
