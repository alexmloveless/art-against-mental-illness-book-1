# Project Decisions Log

This file records all explicit decisions made by Alex (the author) during the book authoring project setup and development.

## Initial Setup Session - 2025-01-13

### File Structure Decisions
- **Decision**: Alex requested I suggest a structure for episode analysis files
- **Rationale**: "The main aim to ensure that relevant info for each episode can be found quickly and easily"
- **Status**: Pending proposal

### Glossary Management
- **Decision**: Build glossary of mistranslations/misspellings as we encounter them
- **Rationale**: Build organically rather than pre-populate
- **Status**: Approved

### Cross-Reference Format
- **Decision**: Use format like `[REF:creativity-basics]` or `[SEE:space-chapter]` for cross-references
- **Rationale**: Allows replacement during compilation without hardcoded chapter numbers
- **Status**: Approved

### AGENT.md Scope
- **Decision**: AGENT.md should contain everything an agent needs to start work without further priming or context
- **Rationale**: Complete self-sufficiency for future agents
- **Status**: Approved

### Progress Tracking Granularity
- **Decision**: Progress should be tracked by identifiable tasks (episode level or more/less granular as appropriate)
- **Rationale**: "The point is that history can quickly and easily tracked, and there is an audit trail of decisions made"
- **Status**: Approved

### Interaction Logging Requirement
- **Decision**: Record ALL interactions between Alex and any agent, including all explicit decisions
- **Rationale**: Complete audit trail and decision history
- **Status**: Approved - this log file created to fulfill this requirement

### Remote Repository Setup
- **Decision**: Add remote repository https://github.com/alexmloveless/art-against-mental-illness-book-1.git
- **Action**: Remote added successfully, push requires authentication setup
- **Status**: Remote configured, push still pending authentication (attempted again 2025-01-13)

### Planning Phase Completion
- **Decision**: All initial planning tasks marked as complete by Alex
- **Date**: 2025-01-13
- **Status**: Planning phase complete, ready for episode processing phase
- **Next Phase**: Begin systematic episode analysis and transcription
