The following are Alex's thoughts on the structure of the book. These should not be considered final, but rather a starting point for discussion and refinement.

- 300 - 400 pages
- If staying within that will be hard given the subjects to cover then we should consider splitting up into multiple books
- It will be converted to audio book, so it should be structured in a way that works for audio
- The introduction will be brief - I hate long introductions
- Each chapter will be self-contained, but also contribute to the overall narrative
- The book will take the reader on a journey. We build my thesis as we go, but individual chapters should make sense on their own
- One of the threads that ties the book together is my story. THis is not an autobiography, but my story is a thread that runs through the book
