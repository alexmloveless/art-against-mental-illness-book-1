Here is a detailed outline of your note [[initial_voice_notes]]

---

**Intro & Purpose**

*   The book is a non-fiction companion to the "Art Against Mental Illness" podcast.
    
    > "You are an author but you exist to write the non-fiction book that distills core themes of my podcast which is called Art Against Mental Illness."
    
*   Each chapter is a standalone subject area, but the book should build as it goes.
    
    > "Each chapter will be a subject area in its own right and can generally be read stand-alone and make sense."
    
*   The book must retain the original voice, style, and tone as much as possible.
    
    > "The book should retain as much of the style, voice, tone as the original source material as possible, retaining words, containing passages that are either exactly lifted from the original or reworded to fit, but maintaining as much of the original wording style tone as possible."

**Process & Workflow**

*   The writing process is iterative, with many drafts and detailed edit history.
    
    > "This project is likely to be broken down over multiple sessions, the book itself will be subject to many drafts, any understanding that you gain at any point in terms of adhering to my requirements and adhering to my voice."
    
*   All progress, notes, and changes must be tracked and committed like code in a git repository.
    
    > "This book will be built using a git repository whereby every chunk, which may mean a whole chapter or may mean a sub-chapter, will be drafted to the levels of completion as dictated by the stage and committed as you would as if it were code."
    
*   Multiple models or bots may work on the book; regular syncing and conflict management are required.
    
    > "It is possible that multiple models will be working on this text at the same time, therefore multiple clones may exist. Therefore, regular refreshes or syncs with remote repo are necessary. I will likely handle any conflicts."

**Maintaining Voice & Consistency**

*   The author’s (Alex’s) voice, tone, and style must be carefully noted for continuity.
    
    > "My voice, tone, style must be noted so that you or other language models or human editors can easily pick up and start again from wherever it was left off."
    
*   All notes, briefs, and updates from Alex must be preserved in their exact form.
    
    > "All notes, briefs, updates, changes to strategy, changes to structure that are input by me, Alex, the author, should be noted in their exact form. And not changed so that there is a full history of my interactions with any model that works on this."
    

---

**Chunked & Modular Approach**

*   Work is done one chunk at a time (chapter, sub-chapter, or paragraph).
    
    > "To maintain manageable context length, you will be asked to work on this one chunk at a time. A chunk might be either a chapter or a sub-chapter or even a paragraph."
    
*   Only relevant context is loaded for each task to avoid overload.
    
    > "You will not read the entire contents of the book into the context, only the bits that are necessary."
    

---

**Cross-Referencing & Indexing**

*   Detailed notes on cross-references and third-party materials are required for the index and bibliography.
    
    > "You will keep very detailed notes on cross-references and also of references to third-party materials, for example, if I mention an artist or an artist. Another podcaster, an author, a person of note, and you will use this to make any relevant cross-references within the text for things like footnotes or citations and to create an index, a detailed index."
    
*   Bibliography will include non-traditional sources like YouTube videos and podcasts.
    
    > "There will also be, at the end of the book, a bibliography that will also contain references to things like YouTube videos or podcasts that I mention or recommend to maintain the core structure of the book."

**Transcription & Glossary Management**

*   Transcriptions are checked in as markdown; audio files are for reference only.
    
    > "The transcription files should be checked in. They will be marked down. They should be checked into the repo, but do not check in any audio files at this point. They are there for your reference."
    
*   Errors in transcription should be corrected, and a glossary created for common mistakes or unique terms.
    
    > "If there are any words or terms of phrase that you simply can't understand or recognise but seem significant, then please ask me what they mean. There will almost certainly be transcription errors. For me, using terms that are very specific to me or the podcast, we should create a glossary file so that common mistranslations or misspellings can easily be corrected."

**Episode & Chapter Structure**

*   Each episode gets its own directory with a consistent file structure.
    
    > "I’ve created a directory that contains directories for each of the episodes that I consider relevant, which will be most of them in the region of 40. They will be numbered in order that they were published, but this must not be considered a mandate for the order of the chapters in the book."
    
*   Summaries and outlines are created for each episode to aid navigation and drafting.
    
    > "You will go through each episode. You will create a summary file in whatever language suits you the most, whatever style suits you. And you will pull out significant passages, paragraphs, terms of phrase, comments or quotes that you feel might be valuable. You will create a an outline of each episode in detail."
    

---

**Drafting & Compilation**

*   No text is committed to the draft until the structure is approved.
    
    > "You will not commit any words to the initial draft until I have approved the structure. We may revise the structure many times before starting to write anything."
    
*   Chapters are drafted in parallel, with notes and references for easy handoff.
    
    > "Since any chapter could be worked on in any order by any bot using any model perhaps in parallel, the notes, drafts and subsequent notes should be left in such a way that it is often picked up at any point by any bot at any time or mere as a human."
    
*   Compilation must allow for flexible chapter ordering and reference updating.
    
    > "If there are cross references in individual chapters, for example, please refer to Chapter X, Chapter 10, where I talk in more detail about some particular subject, then do not include chapter numbers, include some reference that can be used to be replaced with the chapter number and the chapter title when the final compilation happens."

**Audience & Scope**

*   The book is for anyone interested in creativity, not just traditional artists.
    
    > "Stylistically, no. We need to make sure we're not adhering too slavishly to the types of creative enterprise that I do, for example, painting, certain types of writing, certain types of music and music making. I take the broadest possible interpretation of the word art, which includes things like, of course, paintings and sculpture, but writing, music making, theatre, performance, comedy. Even things like coding that have a creative element using language models or image generation models."
    
*   The focus is on using creativity for mental health, not mastery or output.
    
    > "The focus is on, rather than getting to a point of mastery in any given creative enterprise or technique or whatever, to use the process itself as a means to manage mental health. Being able to create wonderful things is a happy side effect, which is really the core thesis of the whole book."

**Philosophical & Practical Elements**

*   The book will reference Zen Buddhism, Stoicism, and other philosophies as helpful, not central.
    
    > "There will be regular references to Zen Buddhism and parts of that philosophy that relate to this and guided me in the past. This is not a book about Zen. Zen is not called to this thesis. It is simply a helpful philosophy in terms of explaining it and therefore other stuff like Stoicism."
    
*   Practical advice and personal exposition are key components.
    
    > "We will be practical wherever appropriate. Again, there are many examples of this. I consider the creative process not simply the time you spend in front of a mise on or with your instruments in your hands or in front of the keyboard. The whole process in terms of mindset, the mise en place, getting yourself the right materials, tidying or preparing your workspace, going out for walks and getting exercise to clear your mind or to ponder and think creatively."

**Final Notes & Best Practices**

*   The process should minimize unnecessary work and avoid revealing AI involvement.
    
    > "The job should be to reduce the amount of work as much as humanly possible. It should not be apparent to anyone at any time that this book was written, co-written by AI, which places even greater emphasis on using my core text as much as possible, where that is not possible for any given reason."
    
*   The process is designed to be reusable for future books and publication-agnostic.
    
    > "As a side note, this process will be used to create subsequent books in a similar way to make sure that the core process is publication agnostic and can be extracted at a later date once it's refined for use on other applications."

**Dyslexia-Friendly Formatting Suggestions**

*   Use a clear, sans-serif font (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, Open Sans).
*   Increase line spacing and margins.
*   Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity.
*   Break up text with headings and subheadings.
*   Use colour-coding to highlight important information (optional).
