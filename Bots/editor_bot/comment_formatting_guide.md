# AI Editor Comment Formatting Guide

## Comment Format Standards

### Basic Comment Format
```
**[AI EDITOR: Your comment here]**
```

### Mode-Specific Comments
```
**[AI EDITOR - MANAGERIAL: Comment for structural/organizational issues]**
**[AI EDITOR - COPY: Comment for grammar/style issues]**
```

### Threaded Conversation Format
```
**[AI EDITOR: Initial comment or question]**
    **[ALEX REPLY: Author response]**
        **[AI EDITOR: Follow-up comment or clarification]**
            **[ALEX REPLY: Further author response]**
                **[AI EDITOR: Final comment or resolution]**
```

## Examples

### Simple Comment
```
The creative process as mental health tool **[AI EDITOR: This core thesis should be explicitly stated earlier in the chapter]** is more important than the final artwork.
```

### Managerial Comment
```
### Chapter 3: Space - Creating Sacred Territory

**[AI EDITOR - MANAGERIAL: This chapter feels disconnected from the previous chapter's flow. Consider adding a transition paragraph that links permission-giving to space creation.]**

**Core Theme**: Environment as foundation for creative wellbeing
```

### Copy Editor Comment
```
Art as therapeutic practice **[AI EDITOR - COPY: "therapeutic" appears 4 times in this paragraph - consider varying the language]** and fundamental human expression.
```

### Threaded Conversation
```
- Process equals product philosophy **[AI EDITOR: This concept needs more explanation - it's central to your thesis but may confuse readers]**
    **[ALEX REPLY: Good point. I explain this more in episode 2. Should I add a paragraph here or reference the upcoming section?]**
        **[AI EDITOR: I'd recommend adding a brief explanation here (2-3 sentences) and then expanding on it in the later section. This gives readers immediate context.]**
            **[ALEX REPLY: Agreed. I'll draft something and run it by you.]**
                **[AI EDITOR: Perfect. Make sure it connects to the mental health angle - that's the key link readers need.]**
```

### Complex Review with Multiple Issues
```
**Chapter Arc**:
- Art as communication beyond verbal barriers **[AI EDITOR - MANAGERIAL: Strong opening point]**
- Process equals product philosophy **[AI EDITOR - COPY: Consider "process-focused philosophy" for clarity]**
- Present moment awareness through creation **[AI EDITOR - MANAGERIAL: This point needs more development - how does it connect to mental health?]**
- Art as storytelling and cultural transmission **[AI EDITOR - MANAGERIAL: This feels like it belongs in the community chapter. Consider moving or explaining the connection to individual mental health.]**
```

## Guidelines for Effective Comments

### DO:
- Be specific and actionable
- Reference line numbers or specific passages when possible
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions
- Offer alternative solutions
- Maintain the friendly adversarial tone
- Use appropriate mode tags (MANAGERIAL vs COPY)

### DON'T:
- Make vague or general comments
- Edit text directly without permission
- Overwhelm with too many comments in one section
- Forget to maintain Alex's voice in suggestions
- Make comments without clear purpose

## Comment Categories

### Structural Comments (MANAGERIAL)

- Narrative arc and pacing
- Theme development and consistency
- Content gaps or redundancies
- Publishing considerations

### Text-Level Comments (COPY)
- Grammar and syntax
- Style and clarity
- Voice consistency
- Readability issues
- Fact-checking needs

### Strategic Comments (MANAGERIAL)
- Publishing timeline concerns
- Market considerations
- Audience appropriateness
- Cross-reference accuracy
- Integration with overall project

## Resolution Tracking

When comments are addressed:
```
**[AI EDITOR: Original comment]**
    **[ALEX REPLY: Author response]**
        **[AI EDITOR: ✓ RESOLVED - Alex added clarifying paragraph in lines 45-48]**
```

When comments are rejected:
```
**[AI EDITOR: Suggested change]**
    **[ALEX REPLY: I prefer to keep this as is because...]**
        **[AI EDITOR: ✓ NOTED - Author preference documented]**
```

## Archive Format

Completed comment threads should be archived in session logs but can be removed from working drafts once resolved to maintain readability.
